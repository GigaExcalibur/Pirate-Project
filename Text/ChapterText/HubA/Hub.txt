[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]Ho, Lua! Let me bend your[N]
ear a wee bit longer.[AN]
[MR]Let me guess. Need me to pay[N]
off your tab again, old man?[AN]
Last I checked, my coffers were[N]
as empty as your guild's soul.[AN]
[ML]Don't take that tone with me, young woman.[AN]
If I felt like it, I could sell your crew[N]
out to the Incendivisi for a pretty penny.[AN]
[3LB]
[MR]As if. The bounty on us right now is[N]
worth jack squat compared to the booty[N]
we've raided from their ships.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][2LB]
You wouldn't pass up the chance to get[N]
in on that, if only for just a sliver.[AN]
[ML]Ha! You're right - I wouldn't dream[N]
of taking the wind out of your sails.[AN]
And, as it so happens, I've got a job[N]
for you and your crew.[AN]
[MR]Spill it. You know we're not[N]
exactly built for honest work.[AN]
[ML]Did I ever take you to the Merchant's[N]
Faire back when you were under my wing?[AN]
[MR]More than once, though they all[N]
blur together as the years go by.[AN]
You taught me to count, but my head still[N]
spins for every zero beyond a million.[AN]
If you ask me, all those nobles' bidding[N]
is just them overcompensating for-[AN]
[ML]Alright, alright, save your breath[N]
for a speech I haven't heard before.[AN]
Ever heard of the island of Balinok?[AN]
[MR]Only from your mouth, when you were[N]
praising the quality of its liquor.[AN]
What do they have to do with the[N]
Merchant's Faire, and with us?[AN]
[3LB]
[ML]Well, about a week ago Incendivis got[N]
a tip that the Balinokos were harboring[N]
rebel activity.[A] They launched a raid on[N]
the islanders, and a noble from House[N]
Sanz swooped in to loot in the aftermath.[AN]
He stole some priceless relics from the[N]
island and is planning to put them up[N]
for auction during the Merchant's Faire.[AN]
[2LB]
[MR]Typical for that scum.[A] I take it your ever-so[N]
bleeding heart won't stand for this?[AN]
[ML]Damn straight![A] The Balinokan chief and I[N]
met in secret, and we made a deal.[AN]
In exchange for a lifetime supply of their[N]
lambanog, I'll recover their relic.[AN]
And your crew will be the ones to break[N]
into House Sanz's guardhouse to do it.[AN]
[MR]So you've signed us up for a dangerous[N]
job that pisses the nobles off,[AN]
all without a penny going to us.[AN]
[ML]Hey, I at least planned your[N]
payment ahead of time.[AN]
If you break into the guardhouse,[N]
you can plunder as much as you like.[AN]
Who knows just what other rarities he[N]
was planning to sell off the Faire?[AN]
So what do you say, Lua? Will you[N]
take the job?[A][X]

[MR]Should I accept Orlando's job for us?[AN]
[No][X]

## HubA1Accepted
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]Alright, you win. I accept.[N]
What's the plan, Orlando?[AN]
[ML]Wonderful! The plan is to break into[N]
the guardhouse tonight. Take this key.[AN]
Once the sun sets, unlock the back door[N]
and await further instructions.[AN]
A Balinokan shaman will arrive to[N]
fill you in on the finer details.[AN]
See you all in two ripples of the tide![AN][ClearFace]
[MR]How the hell did I let myself[N]
get roped into this mess?[AN]
Oh well, I might as well make[N]
this job worth it for us.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadLua][FarFarRight][LoadJaime]
[FarFarRight]
Hey! You![AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][3LB]
You look competent enough. I've got[N]
a dangerous task for anyone who's[N]
up to fighting the Empire.[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
[Beat]Who are you?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
The name's Jaime. I'm a messenger for,[N]
the rebels, and today I bring dire news.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We usually try not to get too involved[N]
with that sort of group[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
LISTEN TO ME! I'll pay you whatever[N]
you want, as long as you rescue her![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
A little feisty, aren't we? Who is[N]
it that you want saved, and how much[N]
are you willing to pay?[AN]
[MidRight]
A rebel base has been discovered by[N]
the Empire! Commander Leonor is there,[N]
and only a few recruits are defending her![AN]
She sent me to go get help, and told me[N]
that anyone who accepted would be paid[N]
whatever they think is fair![AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Calm down. How does 4,000 gold sound?[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Good. Now, you are accepting the job,[N]
aren't you?[AN]

## HubA2Prompt
[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadJaime]
[MidLeft]Should I accept this job?[AN]

## HubA2Accepted
[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadJaime]
[MidLeft][1LB]
[Beat]Fine. I'll go save your commander.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Thank you! I'll lead you to the island,[N]
and then you can do your thing.[AN]
[Beat]By the way, who are you?[AN]
[MidLeft][1LB]
I'm Captain Lua. I lead a pirate crew.[N]
[MidRight][2LB]
You're a pirate, huh? Well, I suppose[N]
Leonor'll have to make do[Beat][AN]

(This Jaime's a strange one. Still,[N]
he seems pretty harmless. I don't[N]
think he could turn on us if he tried[Beat])[AN]

[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRochefort]
[MR]
Excuse me, madam, would you happen[N]
to be Captain Lua?[AN]
[1LB][ML]
That I am, and you are?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
I am Rochefort, a merchant by trade.[AN]
Rumor has it your crew is looking for[N]
work, and it just so happens that I've[N]
been looking for some hired muscle.[AN]
[1LB][ML]
I'm listening. But we don't come cheap.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Oh, I wouldn't dream of underpaying.[N]
I'll offer 10,000 gold for your troubles.[AN]
You see, I hired another crew to deliver[N]
a shipment of spices to a buyer in the[N]
inner empire, but they swindled me![AN]
The scoundrels must have thought they[N]
could profit more by selling the goods[N]
themselves than delivering them.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
So you want us to retrieve[N]
this shipment for you?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Precisely! I'll tag along, of course,[N]
in order to inspect the goods.[AN]
I imagine they'll put up some resistance,[N]
but your crew looks rather accustomed[N]
to violence.[AN]
I know the location of their hideout,[N]
and there shouldn't be more than[N]
a dozen or so of them there.[AN]
Nothing you can't handle, I'm sure.[AN]
My bodyguards, Suzanne and Matteo,[N]
accompany us as well.[AN]
They've worked for me for quite some[N]
time now, and I assure you they're[N]
dependable in a fight.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
A tempting offer. Let me think a[N]
little more and get back to you.[AN]
[MR]
Very well, but please keep in mind[N]
this is a time-sensitive matter.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[3LB][ML]
This job may be just what we need,[N]
but I can't shake the feeling that[N]
Rochefort's hiding something.[AN]
He doesn't seem to be from around here,[N]
but even so, if he's a merchant of good[N]
repute I ought to recognize his name.[AN]
Still, 10,000 gold is a lot of money and[N]
I doubt he'd be foolish enough to try[N]
and double-cross me.[AN]

Alright, we'll do it.[AN]
[MR]
Excellent! How soon can you set sail?[AN]
[3LB][ML]
We can have the ship ready in an hour.[N]
Gather your hired swords and meet me[N]
at the dock. Don't keep me waiting.[AN]

Very well, I am nothing if not punctual![AN]

This better be worth it...[AN]

[FL][LoadPilar]
[L][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
We'll arrive at Port Greagor soon.[N]
You two, how's our prize looking?[N]
Presentable? We can't sell it otherwise.[AN]
[FL]Good enough. There may be questions,[N]
but no evidence to warrant them.[N]
We've cleaned the ship thoroughly.[AN]
[MR][2LB]Is that right? Even with all those[Beat][N]
bodies, aboard? That's not an easy clean.[AN]
[L][3LB]You really haven't been piratin' long,[N]
boss. We got rid of those leagues ago.[N]
Bet they're halfway down to the surface.[AN]
[MR]
You just[Beat] tossed them overboard?[N]
They may have been scum, but surely,[N]
they deserve a burial at the very least.[AN]
[L]
Ha! One of your notions from too much[N]
time selling silks, I see. No, boss.[N]
We don't do that out here in the isles.[AN]
Trash like them? Hate to say it,[N]
but they've got no one who'll mourn.[AN]
And if they did, they shoulda thought[N]
about that before tryin' to kill us.[AN]
[FL]
Yes, that is the law of the skies.[N]
They would spare no pity for us,[N]
so waste none on them, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
I suppose you two are right[Beat][N]
Well, thank you for taking care of it.[AN]
At first, I considered keeping the ship[N]
for ourselves, but a merchant vessel[N]
moves slowly and attracts enemies.[AN]
It would have been nice to have another[N]
ship once our crew grows larger, though.[AN]
[L][2LB]
It's not gonna grow any bigger until[N]
you finally listen to me, boss.[AN]
[MR]
Oh? About what?[AN]
[L]
We need a name! No pirate worth his salt[N]
is gonna join a crew called [OQ]Lua's Crew[CQ].[AN]
My old gang, the Roseblades[Beat][N]
Now that was a damned name![AN]
If you really want a proper fleet,[N]
then at least come up with something.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Do I really have to do that?[AN]
I'm not the creative sort, Desiderio.[N]
For me, trying to come up with names[N]
is like you trying to eat your carrots.[A]
[L]
Oh, come on, I eat my carrots just fine.[N]
It's the greens that don't go down easy[Beat][N]
But you know what the common thread is?[AN]
We may not like it, but it's good for us.[AN]
A name's something that can be feared or[N]
revered among our fellow lawbreakers,[N]
and it's the captain's job to make one.[AN]
[MR]
Bold words for someone who ran from home[N]
over not wanting to eat his vegetables[Beat][N]
Not that I believe that. Fine, you win.[AN]
I'll think of something when we get back.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
[Beat]Are you two done now? Good.[N]
We should split up here, Lua.[AN]
Desiderio and I can dock the new ship[N]
at Port Greagor while you head back.[AN]
Make sure Hermenegildo has not burned[N]
the place down in our absence, hm?[AN]
[MR]
The man's not that incompetent[Beat][N]
I hope. But you're right, Pilar.[AN]
Desiderio, deal with potential buyers[N]
and let me know if anyone is interested.[AN]
Pilar, keep watch on the surroundings[N]
to make sure no one steals it from us.[AN]
[L]
You got it, boss![N]
Just don't forget our cut.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
We will not fail you.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
Now, back to home sweet home[Beat][AN]
I just hope that idiot did his[N]
job, or there'll be hell to pay.[A][X]

## HubABeginningScene2
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[ML][LoadLua]
We're here, Razvan. Did you gather[N]
all your belongings from the ship?[AN]
[MR]
Of course I did! I had my bags[N]
packed hours ago, Captain Lua.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Heh. That eager to get back on land?[N]
You need to work on your sky legs,[N]
or you'll never cut it as a pirate.[AN]
[MR]
Well, I don't intend to stay a pirate,[N]
but you have a point, regardless.[AN]
If I can't handle riding on an airship,[N]
it'll be difficult to accomplish my goals.[N]
Thank you for reminding me, captain![AN]
[ML]
You're too damned serious, Razvan[Beat][N]
It's time for a well-deserved break.[N]
Care to accompany me to the port?[AN]
I could use a helping hand to carry[N]
some purchases, and you could use[N]
real experience with a pirate den.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]I would rather not have[N]
that experience, to be honest.[AN]
[ML]
Are you sure? I'll have plenty of gold[N]
once I sell a few of our recent scores.[AN]
Perhaps even enough for your favorite[Beat][AN]
[MR]
W-What? You couldn't mean-[.4] turr[ó]n?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Oh, I do. Almond paste, honey, and even[N]
more sugar[Beat] Thinking about it makes[N]
my teeth ache, but you're young enough.[AN]
Consider it your reward for excellent[N]
work during our expedition, Razvan.[AN]
[MR]
Captain, I[Beat] No! I won't be tempted![AN]
Thank you, truly, but I must decline.[N]
I want as little to do with pirates[N]
as possible, outside of your crew.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Fair enough, Razvan.[N]
I'll just eat it myself[Beat][AN]
[MR]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[ML]
Oh, don't look at me like that.[AN]
I'm only joking[Beat] Wait,[N]
is someone behind me?[AN]
[ML][MoL]
[FL][LoadHermenegildo][3LB]
Captain! It is oh so wonderful[N]
to see that you have returned,[N]
unharmed! Might I carry your luggage?[AN]
[L]
Oh, it's just you, Hermen.[N]
You took a long while to greet us[Beat][N]
What if we were intruders, instead?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
I-I was watching the front door,[N]
just like you told me to, captain![AN]
But, since it is so far from here,[N]
I could not hear your grand arrival.[AN]
[L]
Hm[Beat] Well, I'm satisfied that the[N]
place seems to have survived our trip.[AN]
Consider the debt reduced by a thousand[N]
doubloons for your service, Hermen.[AN]
That leaves nine thousand for you to pay[N]
to compensate the cost those Rioja Reapers[N]
demanded. All to make you a free man[Beat][AN]
A bit overpriced, if you ask me,[N]
but you're a knowledgeable fellow.[N]
You've proven yourself very useful.[AN]
[FL]
Thank you so much, c-captain![N]
I will continue to do all that I can[N]
to work off that debt, so[Beat][AN]
Might I receive a tome,[N]
to better aid you in battle?[AN]
[L][2LB]
If you want me to add it to your tab,[N]
then sure. I'll buy any tome you like.[AN]
[FL]
N-Never mind, then. I can wait until[N]
my debt is fully paid off for that.[AN]
[MR]
Mr. Hermenegildo, I'm interested[N]
in learning how to use tomes myself,[AN]
so that I'm less of a burden here[Beat][N]
Please, would you teach me your ways?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm. Well, learning tomelore is quite[N]
demanding, boy. I am not sure whether[N]
a child from the outskirts can learn-[AN]
[L]
That's a fine idea, Razvan. Hermen,[N]
if you agree, I'll knock two thousand[N]
off of your debt if it bears fruit.[AN]
[FL][TS]
[Beat]But you are such an intelligent lad,[N]
that I believe you can do anything![N]
With enough instruction, that is.[AN]
Come now, let us retreat to the library.[N]
I will teach you all that I learned in the[N]
capital, out of the goodness of my heart![A]
[MR][2LB]
Really? Thank you so much, sir![N]
I won't betray your faith in me.[A][CSS]
[FL][CF][MR][CF]
[L]
Ha[Beat] That blowhard cracks me up.[N]
That alone was worth the ten thousand.[AN]
Well, I'd better not delay any longer[Beat][N]
And I'll bring back a turr[ó]n, too.[A][X]

[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
[Beat]Not an imperial guardsman in sight,[N]
sticking their nose out like pigs,[N]
and this place is all the better for it.[AN]
The guilds technically run the show,[N]
sure, but they're too busy arguing with[N]
each other to worry about any pirates.[AN]
So long as we keep things clean here[N]
and don't break any of the codes that[N]
the Greagor Five's leaders have set,[AN]
there's no better place to do business.[AN]
[Beat]Now, let me take a look at the haul.[AN]
Once I subtract all the journey's costs,[N]
the wages of my crew, and the rest[Beat][N]
I've got five thousand gold for myself.[AN]
That's quite a sum[Beat] I'll have plenty[N]
for Razvan's pastry, just like I thought.[A]
[ML][LoadIda]
Well, look what the cat dragged in.[N]
I'd been wondering whether you got[N]
shanked on your way here, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
Come on, you know that I'm too tough[N]
for something like that to stop me.[N]
To what do I owe the pleasure, Ida?[AN]
It's not every day that the leader[N]
of the Shipwright's Guild and the[N]
Greagor Five talks to someone like me.[AN]
[ML]
I'm a busy woman, so cut the sarcasm.[N]
An odd fellow down by the docks is[N]
looking for you, by your man[Beat][AN]
Desiderio, was it? They seem to be[N]
in some kind of dispute over something.[AN]
[MR]
An odd fellow? He must be strange indeed[N]
to appear that way to you, since you've[N]
seen all sorts of people in this port.[AN]
Thanks for letting me know, Ida.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Well, I'll be on my way.[AN]
[MR]
Ah, hold on a moment.[N]
I have a request for you.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Of course you do.[N]
Out with it, then.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
The Liberator took a beating during[N]
our last expedition. Desiderio and I[N]
can't fix it ourselves, I'm afraid,[AN]
so would you mind sending a carpenter[N]
to our cove? I'll pay well, of course.[N]
My ship is worth any price I can afford.[A]
[ML]
You better be, if I'm sending one of my[N]
people to a pirate den[Beat] Fine, I have[N]
a protege in mind who can handle it.[AN]
Pay me two thousand gold, upfront.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
A steep price[Beat] but you've never[N]
let me down before. Here you are.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Good. A girl named Rahel will be there[N]
within the hour. A pleasure, as always.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
That woman never smiles unless[N]
she's got gold in hand, does she?[AN]
No wonder she made it to the top.[AN]
Well, I'd better go see who that[N]
[OQ]odd fellow[CQ] is and what he wants.[A][X]

[MR][LoadLua]
Ah, Pilar. Any issues nearby our[N]

Well, except that girl over there.[AN][CSSCF][MR][CF]
[ML][LoadEstelle]
[MR][LoadSailor]
[MR]
Didn't you hear me the first time?[N]
You're mad, woman! Get off my ship![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Very well. If that is what you[N]
wish, I will leave without delay.[A][CSSCF][MR][CF]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
Looks like that girl's trying to gain[N]
passage[Beat] Well, none of our concern.[AN]
[ML]
I'm afraid it is, Lua.[N]
She approaches us as we speak.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] Any chance that you'll[N]
deal with it for me, Pilar?[AN]
[ML]
None. You represent the crew,[N]
so you should hear her out.[AN]
If it seems not worth our while,[N]
then turn her down if you must.[AN]
[MR]
Fair enough.[AN]
[ML][MoL]
[FL][LoadEstelle]
[MR]Let's have it, then.[N]
What do you want, girl?[A]
[FL]
Simply to ask a question, miss.[N]
Would you happen to be a pirate?[AN]
[MR]
And if I am?[AN]
[FL]
Please, let me come aboard your ship![AN]
I'll do anything that you ask of me,[N]
so long as you fulfill my wish.[AN]
[MR]
Your wish? Slow down a bit, lass.[AN]
For the right price, I might agree,[N]
but what exactly do you want?[AN]
I'm assuming it isn't just[N]
sailing the skies, right?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What do you think of the stars?[AN]
[MR]
Huh? How does that answer my question?[AN]
[L]
Just humor the girl, Lua.[N]
I'm sure it will make sense.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well[Beat] They look nice at night?[AN]
I've passed many evening watches[N]
looking up at the stars in the sky.[N]
I imagine most sailors have.[AN]
Beyond that, I can't say I have[N]
any strong feelings about them.[N]
They're just there, always.[AN]
[FL]
I see[Beat] However, I am not satisfied[N]
merely looking up at their visage.[AN]
I desire nothing less than to visit[N]
them myself, upon an airship![AN]
Such is what I told that sailor,[N]
but he scoffed at my dream.[AN]
I was nearly about to give up hope,[N]
but I believed in my divination[N]
that a pirate would come to my aid.[AN]
And now, here you are, Miss Lua.[N]
It feels like fate, does it not?[AN]
[MR]
When did I give you my name?[N]
And[Beat] Did you say divination?[N]
As in, seeing the future?[AN]
[FL]
I know many things that I should not.[AN]
Were you to let me join your merry band,[N]
I could use my ability as you command[Beat][N]
Though I admit, it is not always reliable.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
I admit that I'm having a hard time[N]
believing your claims, but[Beat][AN]
What do you think of them, Pilar?[AN]
[L]
It would be best not to judge from[N]
the lens of one raised in the Empire.[AN]
Out in these isles, and even beyond,[N]
the impossible can become very real[Beat][AN]
[L]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] What's your name, lass?[AN]
[ML]
You may call me Estelle.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
To tell you the truth, I have no idea[N]
how to sail an airship that far up.[N]
Anyone that's tried has crashed first.[AN]
If you still want to join us knowing that,[N]
then I'll let you, on one condition.[AN]
You'll have to pull your own weight,[N]
with or without your divinations.[AN]
Pilar, can you show her the ropes?[A]
[L]
Of course. Listen to me, Estelle.[N]
While common sense may dictate your[N]
dream impossible, do not give up yet.[AN]
Anything can happen in this wide world.[N]
Take it from me, one who has lived long[N]
enough to see such things firsthand.[A]
[FL]
I[Beat] Thank you so much, Miss Pilar![N]
And you as well, Miss[Beat] Captain Lua![AN]
I promise that I will be of service.[N]
In fact, I had payment in mind, but[Beat][N][MoFL][MoFL]
Oh, I just cannot find it anywhere![AN]
[MR]
Well, you can give it to me later.[N]
I've got some business to take care of,[N]
so we can talk more later, Estelle.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Y-Yes. Thank you again![A][X]

Well, that girl was a bit strange[Beat][N]
I hope she gives up on her idea[N]

It's a wonder that man ever manages[N]
sneak attacks, with his damned voice.[A][CSSCF]

[FFR]
I've already told you, merchant.[N]
I'm not gonna sell you this boat[N]

Oh? But what if I decide to purchase[N]
another, instead? I suspect your[N]

She might be, true, but she'd put me[N]
in shackles if I did what you want.[N]
I'll take some mean words over that.[AN]
[FFL]
Oh, you exaggerate far too much.[N]
Your captain and I go way back,[N]
and she was never a cruel mistress.[AN]
[Beat]If she did imprison you for this,[N]
it would only last a day, at most![AN]
Surely that much is worth my coin?[AN]
[MR][LoadLua]
A buyer[Beat] but this one sounds like[N]
trouble. I'd better deal with him,[N]
or he'll never leave Desiderio alone.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[R][LoadDesiderio]
[FR][LoadLua]
[R][2LB]
Ah, boss! Took ya long enough.[AN]
This guy won't take no for an answer,[N]
so you gotta tell him[Beat] Boss?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]What are you doing here, Orlando?[N]
This is no place for a man like you.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, you flatter me, Lua.[AN]
I was just looking for you,[N]
so I'm glad you showed up.[AN]
[FR]
It wasn't a compliment.[AN]
[R]
Uh, boss?[N]
Mind filling me in?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]The short of it is that this man[N]
is a dog of the Merchant's Guild.[AN]
His name is Orlando Felicitas,[N]
and you'll find no one more pompous.[AN]
[ML]
I'm quite a bit more than a dog now,[N]
you know[Beat][A] And it was not so long ago[N]
that you were one of us, as well.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Enough. What do you want of me,[N]
and why do you want my ship?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I hoped that we could discuss old times[N]
and what brought you to these lawless[N]
isles. Perhaps over drinks, like always?[AN]
I really am interested in that ship,[N]
though, as an addition to my fleet.[AN]
Ah, but such talk should be discrete,[N]
yes? No offense to your servant here,[N]
but I don't trust him as I do you.[AN]
[R]
Servant? You've got the wrong idea, pal.[N]
I may be Lua's right hand, but I serve[N]
out of choice, not an obligation.[AN]
So, even if you're her old buddy,[N]
if you think you can disrespect me,[N]
I've got a fist with your name-[AN]
[FR]
Desiderio, don't! He's not worth it.[AN]
[Beat]You're as incomprehensible as always,[N]
Orlando. If you really want privacy,[N]
I have my own quarters back at my base.[AN]
But you're only coming as a potential[N]
buyer, so don't act the fool like usual.[N]
I'm not your apprentice anymore.[AN]
[ML]
Ha, very well. Lead the way,[N]
my sharp-tongued student.[N]
We have much to discuss[Beat][A][X]

[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadOrlando]
[R]
Well, this is it. Don't snoop[N]
anywhere that I can't see you.[AN]
[FR]
Ha! A demon like you certainly[N]
has eyes in the back of her head.[AN]
But worry not, I will refrain.[N]
Is that girl one of yours?[AN]
[R]
Never seen her in my life,[N]
so she must be one of Ida's.[AN]
[ML][LoadRahel]
You[Beat] You match Master Ida's[N]
description of the captain.[AN]
Can you tell this goon to let[N]
me in already so I can work?[AN]
[R]
Goon? Oh, you must mean Hermenegildo.[N]
Hermen, open the door already![AN]
We've got guests waiting.[AN]
[FFL]
W-What's the password?[AN]
[R][3LB]
[Beat]If I have to give you that,[N]
then your debt's going back[N]
to ten thousand doubloons.[AN]
[FFL]
Eep! That was simply a test, Captain Lua.[N]
You never know when an impersonator may[N]
arrive, mimicking your elegant voice![AN]
The door will open immediately,[N]
so please do not increase my debt![AN]
[R]
Good. By the way, what's your name?[N]
Just checking that you're really[N]
Ida's apprentice and all.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Rahel. Now, I've got work to do,[N]
so don't disturb me anymore.[A][CSSCF]
[FR]
Not a very sociable one, is she?[AN]
[R]
I welcome it,[N]
in comparison to you.[AN]
[FR]
Rude, but fair.[N]
Well, lead the way![A][X]

## HubABeginningScene6_2
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Take a seat wherever you like, and[N]
let's get down to business, Orlando.[N]
Tell me why you're really here.[AN]
[ML]
Oh? Well, for starters, I would like[N]
to purchase that merchant galleon.[N]
Say[Beat] For five thousand gold, perhaps?[AN]
You could sell it a bit higher,[N]
but any observant individual would[N]
notice the recent battle upon it.[AN]
That knocks the price down a peg,[N]
but my associates can clean it quite[N]
thoroughly and make a tidy profit.[AN]
[MR]
Seems like a fair price to me.[N]
But I asked why you're really here,[N]
and that isn't the real answer, is it?[AN]
[ML]
Sharp as always. To tell the truth,[N]
I heard tales of a swashbuckling pirate[N]
captain targeting merchants recently.[AN]
But not just any merchants, mind you,[N]
she targeted those deep in bed[N]
with the Imperial Marines.[AN]
When I think of pirates, I typically[N]
do not imagine them choosy about their[N]
targets, let alone as selective as that.[AN]
Well, perhaps one with a grievance[Beat][AN]
[MR][2LB]
So you thought of me?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Admittedly a bit of a reach,[N]
but I've always enjoyed a gamble.[N]
In any case, I come on guild business.[AN]
Your absence the past few months greatly[N]
impacted our operations, says the chief.[N]
He asked that you return to the fold.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
No.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
And I told him you would say that.[N]
Well, at least I tried, eh?[AN]
I have to admit that I was surprised[N]
when I saw you. In only a few months,[N]
you have become quite the pirate, Lua.[AN]
[Beat]Is it because of that tragedy?[AN]
[MR]
That was only the trigger, Orlando.[AN]
The thievery of my wares, and the refusal[N]
of the marines to save me from ruin[Beat][N]
Only a prelude that showed me the truth.[AN]
The empire is built on a house of cards,[N]
propped up by the wealth of the few[N]
and the tyranny of the marines.[AN]
But here, I'm free for once in my life.[N]
I don't plan on ever going back.[AN]
[ML]
I sympathize with your position, Lua,[N]
but are you truly satisfied with this?[AN]
The pirates in bedtime stories journey[N]
on grand adventures and find great[N]
treasure. But you[Beat] hunt merchants?[AN]
[MR][2LB]
What are you getting at?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
A grand adventure, of course.[N]
As it happens, quite a few interesting[N]
occurrences have manifested, as of late.[AN]
All related to mysterious movements[N]
of the Imperial Marines that you hate,[N]
in the direction of these very isles,[AN]
and further. It is rare enough to see[N]
a marine vessel at all out here[Beat][N]
But as many as the rumors say?[AN]
They seek something, Lua.[N]
Perhaps even[Beat] the Fire Emblem.[A]
[MR]
Not this again, Orlando. The idea that[N]
some magical artifact raised these isles[N]
into the skies is completely absurd.[AN]
It's something I'd expect from a drunkard[N]
at the tavern, not from a top merchant.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, am I not allowed to dream?[AN]
At the very least, those marines[N]
are searching for something valuable[N]
in lands fraught with mystery.[AN]
Does that not excite your spirit?[N]
Would you not like to steal it,[N]
right from under their noses?[AN]
[MR]
I get the idea, so shut it already.[AN]
[Beat]I'll have to ask the crew and mull[N]
it over before deciding whether we[N]
should go further into the outskirts.[AN]
We'll need more crewmates at the least,[N]
and the coin to pay and feed them.[AN]
[ML]
Take all the time you like.[AN]
I can provide coin, so long as you[N]
help me in return. As it happens,[N]
I require lodging during my stay.[AN]
[MR]
I doubt they're what you're used to,[N]
but I've got a few empty rooms down[N]
in the basement. Take your pick.[AN]
[ML]
If those are the best accomodations,[N]
then I suppose that is good enough.[AN]
It will take some time to unpack,[N]
so we can stop here for now, Lua.[N]
Please, give my words some thought.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
It's rare for him to stop talking[N]
voluntarily[Beat] Well, whatever.[AN]
He's got a point that things have[N]
gotten boring around here lately,[N]
so a change of pace might be good.[AN]
For now though, I should snoop[N]
around the port, expand the crew,[N]
and grab whatever gold I can find.[AN]
[Beat]And think of that damned name.[A][X]
