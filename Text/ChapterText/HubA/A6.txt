[FL]
This is incredible...[AN]
At last, we have the power to[N]
strike back at the empire![AN]
This looks like enough to level[N]
the imperial palace![AN]
[3LB][L]
Don't be ridiculous, we'd never[N]
get close enough. They'd blast us[N]
out of the sky.[AN]
How about Delgado Harbor?[N]
It'd be easy to slip in and out[N]
unsuspected.[AN]
[MR]
No, that won't do. Too many innocents[N]
will be harmed.[AN]
We want to hit the imperial dogs, not[N]
those suffering under their tyranny.[AN]
We've got enough for two targets,[N]
so we'll attack the marine barracks[N]
and the imperial smithy.[AN]
Anyone fool enough to serve the[N]
Imperial Navy deserves what's coming.[AN]
[L]
Right as ever, boss.[N]
Heh, I can't wait to stick it[N]
to those imperial bastards.[AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[FL]
Bad news, Santiago. There's an[N]
incoming ship, and its crew[N]
looks ready for a fight.[AN]
[R]
Just my luck...[N]
How the hell did this happen?[AN]
You didn't blab about this, did you?[N]
To anyone other than me, that is.[AN]
[2LB][L]
No way! You gave us a better deal[N]
than we could've dreamt of.[AN]
Wasn't much point looking for other[N]
buyers after an offer like yours.[AN]
[FL]
It must be that idiot merchant who[N]
hired us to move the goods.[AN]
Didn't think he had it in him to[N]
pick a fight with us over this.[AN]
[MR]
Doesn't matter anymore, looks like[N]
we've got a fight on our hands.[AN]
Lucky for us, we rebels are always[N]
ready for battle.[AN]
I trust your men can hold their own?[AN]
[L]
You bet! C'mon boys, let's welcome[N]
our uninvited guests![AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier]
[3LB][MR]
My comrades, this is a fight we must win.[AN]
But if we should fall, we cannot allow[N]
the enemy to learn of our plans.[AN]
Quickly, set up explosives around the[N]
cave. If we win this battle, we'll[N]
disarm them afterwards, but if not...[AN]
The cause is greater than any one of us.[N]
If the worst comes to pass, we'll bury[N]
the enemy in here with us.[AN]
[1LB][FL]
Yes sir![AN]
[L]
We're with you to the end![AN]
[MR]
Good, let's give them hell![AN]

[R][LoadLua][FR][LoadRochefort]
[R]
Come on out! We're here for the[N]
spice shipment you stole![AN]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[1LB][FL]
Spice shipment?[AN]
[1LB][L]
The hell are you talking about?[AN]
[3LB][R]
Playing dumb won't help.[N]
Now hand it over, and[N]
no one has to get hurt.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
We've stolen a lot of stuff,[N]
but spices ain't one of them.[AN]
[1LB][L]
Always preferred my food mild myself.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
That's not what... ah forget it.[N]
You want a fight, you've got one![AN]
[L]
Wait, isn't that the guy who hired[N]
us to transport the-[N]
[FR]
Captain Lua, I'm afraid we've no[N]
choice but to battle it out.[AN]
[3LB][R]
What the hell is going on? Rochefort,[N]
if there's something you're keeping[N]
from me, now's the time to explain.[AN]
[FR]
I've been nothing but forthright with[N]
you. What are you waiting for?[N]
I didn't hire you to chat![AN]
[FR][ClearFace]
[2LB][R]
This whole situation reeks. Desiderio,[N]
lift the anchor, we're turning around.[AN]
[FFR]
No can do, captain.[N]
They've already got us grappled![AN]
[3LB][FL]
You think we'll let you go so easily?[N]
You've got a mighty fine ship,[N]
I think we'll add it to our collection![AN]
[R][MoveFarRight]
[3LB][R][LoadSuzanne]
Finally, some action. Come on, meathead![N]
Your face'll look so much better[N]
filled with lead![AN]
[2LB][L]
Bring it on, girl![N]
I've been itching for a good fight.[AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[3LB][R][LoadMatteo]
Don't get started without me![AN]
You don't look like much, think[N]
you can keep up with a swordsman[N]
of my caliber?[AN]
[2LB][FL][MoveLeft]
Is that a challenge? Lucky for you, you[N]
won't live long enough to regret it![AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[FR]
Oh no... Looks like we're going with[N]
plan A, crew! To arms![AN]
