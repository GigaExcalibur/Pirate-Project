// Jaime:
// Age: late 20s
// Appearence: same hair color as Carmen, long hair that covers one of his eyes,
// square chin, stubble, aggressive but worried expression, some sort of hat.
// A young rebel. Aggressive and quick to anger, with strong convictions. However,
// he's actually a runaway noble and a relative of Carmen. He's trying to hide this, because
// he doesn't think the rebels will accept him if they knew the truth. Probably have
// him interact with her a few times if she's alive. His real name is Hector del Rian.

// Leonor:
// Age: mid 30s
// Appearence: Muscular, reddish hair, 
// battered clerical garb, some sort of facial scar.
// Originally a laborer for hire, she was attacked by a drunk Imperial soldier
// and became bitter when the Empire wouldn't take action against him. This,
// combined with universally low pay for difficult manual labor, convinced her
// to join the rebellion. Despite lacking magical talent, she was trained as a
// healer, and after a paricularly fatal battle with the Empire in which most of
// the highest-ranking rebel healers were killed, she rose to a leadership position.
// Secretly, she's a bit tired of being a prominent rebel, and is looking for new
// side opportunities so she can disappear for a while.

// Felipe
// Age: early 30s
// Appearence: Dark skin, messy hair, tiny moustache, fancy armor
// An imperial noble who used his social status to become a lieutenant in
// the imperial army. His confidence in his abilities is greater than
// his actual abilities, but he does have somewhat absurd luck.

Leonor Diaz! Rebel scum! You are surrounded![N]
Surrender now, or be annihilated![AN]
[MidRight]
Annihilated? We can beat you Incendivis[N]
pawns with one hand tied behind our backs![AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph. I see you're not going to listen to[N]
reason, so you leave me no choice![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadRebel][3LB]
Uh[Beat] Boss? One of those soldiers has[N]
a mortar. We're new recruits, and I doubt[N]
we can face such a powerful weapon.[AN]
[MidRight]
If we're captured, we'll be executed at best.[N]
Better to go out fighting, in my opinion.[N]
I just hope Jaime arrives with help in time[Beat][AN]

Commander Leonor is somewhere in there[Beat][N]
You'd better not fail.[AN]
[MidRight]
My crew doesn't fail easily.[N]
Your commander will be in good hands.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Still, I'd like to assist. I think[N]
that a pegasus rider would be an asset[N]
to a rescue mission like this.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Make sure not to get yourself killed.[N]
It's hard to pay us when you're dead.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't like the implication that I'd[N]
lose, but fine.[AN]

Jaime! You're here![AN]

Yeah. I hired some pirates to[N]

we should be safe.[AN]

Pirates[Beat] I don't trust their[N]
