escape guardhouse.[X]

## ChA1BeginningScene1
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]This is the place. Desiderio,[N]
any sign of our shaman liaison?[AN]
[ML]Not that I can see. [Beat]What's[N]
do we do next, Captain?[AN]
[MR]Damn, I can't stand sitting here[N]
twiddling our thumbs waiting.[AN]
Scout the perimeter, men! Let's[N]
scope our entry and exit points.[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene2
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse's outer walls[N]
are chipped in a few places.[AN]
A quick chop of an axe - nay, even[N]
a stiff breeze - could break it down.[AN]
[MR]Let's count our lucky stars[N]
Count Sanz is a big cheapskate.[AN]
If he didn't want us to kick his walls[N]
in, he should've maintained them better.[AN]
Anything else catch your eye?[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene3
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse connects to other[N]
buildings in the east and south.[AN]
[MR]I remember this one.[AN]
East is the Merchant Faire auction hall,[N]
and south are the nobles' quarters.[AN]
House Sanz owns the place, and they[N]
rent it out to auctioneers and bidders.[AN]
[ML]Can we get out through either?[AN]
[MR]Doubtful. The auction hall is heavily[N]
patrolled by security guards right now,[AN]
and the nobles all have personal[N]
bodyguards that'd rip us to shreds.[AN]
The only way to escape is fleeing north[N]
and losing them under cover of darkness.[AN]
[FFL]HEY![A] You two, over here![A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene4
[FFL][LoadIndio]
[R][LoadDesiderio]
[FR][LoadLua]
[FFL][MoFL]
[FL]Hello hello, Orlando's Pirates![AN]
Name's Indio Medina, a shaman[N]
from the island of Balinok.[AN]
*Huff*[Beat] *puff*[Beat] Sorry I'm late![AN]
Slow legs, and all that.[AN]
Now then, let's begin with the briefing![N]
On the east side of the guardh-[AN]
[R]You're too late, kid. We already[N]
scouted out the perimeter.[AN]
[FR]And since when were we [OpenQuote]Orlando's Pirates?[CloseQuote][N]
I'm the captain here, name's Lua.[AN]
We were told you'd fill us in on[N]
the details of Orlando's plan.[AN]
[R]Speaking of, why isn't Orlando here[N]
to give us the details himself?[AN]
Is he tied up in something?[AN]
[FL]Exactly! Orlando's role is to[N]
providing cover for this heist.[AN]
Count Sanz is notoriously paranoid[N]
about his treasure being stolen.[AN]
Orlando's job is to keep him distracted[N]
while you guys recover the relic.[AN]
[R]But the guardhouse is still[N]
heavily guarded, correct?[AN]
[FL]Yep yep! The Count's hired some mercs[N]
to bolster his regular guard regime.[AN]
We will need to punch through them[N]
to reach the relic stored inside.[AN]
[FR]What do you mean, [OpenQuote]we?[CloseQuote][AN]
[FL]Oh, did I forget to mention that?[AN]
Orlando and the village elder gave me[N]
permission to go on this mission too![AN]
Oh! Only if it's okay with you,[N]
your captainness.[AN]
[FR][Beat][AN]
[R]Your decision, Captain Lua?[AN]
[FR]We won't look a gift shark in the mouth.[AN]
You're free to join us, Indio, but it won't[N]
be fun and games. We all pull our weight.[AN]
[FL]You got it! I'll try harder than anyone's[N]
ever tried, you can count on that![AN]
[FR]Fantastic. In that case[Beat] Desiderio,[N]
you're on babysitting duty.[AN]
[R]What?! Don't just pawn them off on me![A][X]

## ChA1InformObjectiveDialogue
[ML][LoadIndio][MR][LoadLua]
[ML]Our target is that northeast chest.[AN]
[MR]That's the one with your island's relic?[AN]
[ML]Yesserie! You can tell cause Count Sanz's[N]
guard captains are the ones keeping watch.[AN]
[MR]You heard that, men? Once we nab that[N]
chest, we get the hell out of here.[AN]
Steal everything that isn't nailed down,[N]
and make sure we [Red]leave no man behind[Red].[A][X]

## ChA1CarmenIndioTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadIndio][MR][LoadCarmen]
[ML]Wow! That's quite the fiddle you've got.[AN]
[MR]Aw, thank you! I'm glad someone around[N]
here can appreciate perfect craftsmanship.[AN]
It's an Arriort[ú]an, after all.[AN]
[ML]Hm? Arriort[ú]an, you say? Can I[N]
see that for just a second?[AN]
[MR][MoL]
[L][MoMR]
[ML]Oh yeah, now that I'm looking at[N]
it up close I can see that.[AN]
You see, Arriort[ú]a was an Incendivis[N]
artisan obsessed with local instruments.[AN]
He ripped off their designs, but was[N]
never able to make them sound the same.[AN]
And if you look here, you can see why.[AN]
He cheaped out on the wood and strings,[N]
making them too thin and too matted.[AN]
By chance has the crew ever complained[N]
about the way your fiddle sounded?[AN]
[MR]Um[Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh, and it gets even worse than that.[AN]
After he retired, I heard Arriort[ú]a took up[N]
a position tutoring young nobles in magic.[AN]
Given his work on violins, I hope those poor[N]
kids unlearn his improper techniques.[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh! Here's your instrument back.
[ML][MoR]
[R][MoML]
[ML]Sorry for taking up so much of your time.[AN]
Just between you and me, Balinokans[N]
love their gossip.[AN]
Anyway, I've got to get back to it. Maybe[N]
you can play for me sometime. See you![AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]Damn it, Arriort[ú]a! It's your blasted[N]
fault nobody here appreciates my talents.[A][X]

## ChA1PilarRazvanTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadPilar][MR][LoadRazvan]
[MR]I fear I'm going to go blind from[N]
all the decadence in this room.[AN]
How can Count Sanz sleep at night[N]
when it's so bright nearby?[AN]
[ML][Beat]Soundly, I imagine.[AN]
[MR]How many people could this fortune feed?[AN]
A hundred, a thousand, maybe even a million![AN]
[ML]Maybe not that much.[AN]
[MR]What drives a man to amass such copius[N]
amounts of unnecessary wealth?[AN]
[ML]Human nature.[AN]
[MR]Pilar? Whatever are you saying?[AN]
[ML]That's the way the world works.[AN]
People will do anything for the status[N]
and security a fat purse provides.[AN]
That their prosperity comes at the[N]
expense of others is a non-issue.[AN]
I'm the same, Captain Lua's the same,[N]
we're all the same.[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[ML]Okay, you're not the same.[AN]
What do you do with your cut of the[N]
booty, now that it's on my mind?[AN]
[MR]I donate every cent to the church.[AN]
We preach that all the gold in the[N]
world was given to us by the Maker,[AN]
and that in the end all gold will[N]
return to Their loving hands.[AN]
[ML]Wait, the church says to give[N]
all the gold you make to them?[AN]
[MR]Yes. The church is free from the sin and[N]
corruption of excess wealth you describe.[AN]
We are the only ones that deserve to hold[N]
it for the Maker to retrieve later.[AN]
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off![AN]
These coins shall be delivered unto[N]
our glorious savior![AN][ClearFace]
[ML][Beat]If only we were all that naive, maybe[N]
this world would be a better place.[A][X]

## ChA1GeraldoLeavesDialogue
[ML][LoadLeandra][MR][LoadGeraldo]
[ML]Gerry, what the hell are we doing here?[AN]
[MR]What are you talking about, Leandra?[AN]
[ML]We're being paid peanuts to stand around[N]
a dark room and watch over some boxes.[AN]
A guard said there's more gold in one[N]
chest than we'd see in our whole lives.[AN]
[MR]So? Work's work, isn't it?[AN]
[ML]That's not the point, and you know it.[AN]
You'd think a man of such wealth'd be[N]
willing to pay a little more to protect it.[AN]
[MR]Stuff it. Right now, Count Sanz is[N]
the man putting food in our bellies.[AN]
[ML]Yeah, barely. Just think, Gerry![AN]
If we took just a fraction of this[N]
room's gold, we could eat like kings![AN]
[MR]Yeah, as your last meal before[N]
they hang you for burglary.[AN]
Be thankful for this opportunity[N]
to be on the straight and narrow.[AN]
Or would you rather still be out[N]
there on the run as a pirate?[AN]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[MR]I'm gonna go do some rounds through[N]
the underground tunnels now.[AN]
Standing around here is gonna make[N]
my legs get stiff.[AN]
If you need me, just holler and I'll[N]
come up from some other staircase.[AN][ClearFace]
[ML]You're too shortsighted, Gerry.[AN]
Just think of how much we could make[N]
without licking the boots of House Sanz.[A][X]

## ChA1LuaLeandraTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]Oi, sellsword. If you know what's good[N]
for you, you'll turn tail and leave now.[AN]
[MR]Oh believe me, I already know[N]
this job is no good for me.[AN]
But Count Sanz is the one paying,[N]
so he's the one I'm serving[Beat][AN]
Unless someone was willing to[N]
match his offer, I'd say.[AN]
[ML]He's holding out on you, then?[AN]
[MR]Damn straight! You know how much[N]
he's paying us for this job?[AN]
3000 gold! That's a blasted drop in[N]
the gallons of funds he makes![AN]
Just think of what I could do with[N]
his kind of luxury.[AN]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[MR]But of course, that'll have to[N]
wait until we're done here.[AN]
What's your call, lady? You gonna[N]
recognize the worth of my axe?[AN]
Cause if not, I'd be glad to show[N]
you the receiving end of it.[A][X]

## ChA1DesiderioLeandraTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadDesiderio][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]What the- Leandra? Is that you?[AN]
[MR]Desiderio?! Are my eyes[N]
playing tricks on me?[AN]
I haven't seen you since the Roseblades.[AN]
I see you've been keeping well,[N]
plundering an armed guardhouse.[AN]
[ML]I could say the same about you, Leandra.[AN]
I thought working as a grunt for House[N]
Sanz would be beneath someone like you.[AN]
[MR]Alas, merc work is drying up these days,[N]
what with Incendivis' expansion and all.[AN]
[ML]You could never work an honest[N]
living a day in your life.[AN]
[MR]Calling the kettle black, much?[AN]
I thought you of all people would[N]
understand my situation.[AN]
[ML]It's because I do that I'm about[N]
to offer you a spot in my crew.[AN]
Captain Lua's a good woman, you'd[N]
like serving under her.[AN]
It'll be just like old times.[AN]
[MR]Old times don't pay the tab, Desiderio.[AN]
You want my services, I'll need a bit of[N]
insurance in case this job goes south.[AN]
3000 gold'll suffice.[A][X]

## ChA1LeandraRecruitPrompt
[ML][LoadCurrent][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]Should I hire Leandra for 3000 gold?[AN]
[Yes][X]

## ChA1LeandraRecruitedDialogue
[ML][LoadCurrent][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]You've got a deal. Welcome[N]
to the crew, Leandra.[AN]
[MR]So you've got a lick of sense.[AN]
Now, if you don't mind I simply must[N]
break the news to my old boss.[A][X]

## ChA1TimerWarningDialogue
[ML][LoadLua]
[ML]I hear voices from the underground tunnels.[AN]
Pick up the pace, men! As soon as the alarm[N]
goes off, we'll be surrounded.[A][X]

## ChA1RelicRecoveredDialogue
[ML][LoadLua]
[ML]That's the relic recovered![AN]
Everyone, get to an exit[N]
and run like hell![A][X]

## ChA1AlarmRaisedDialogue
[ML][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
[ML]Intruders! Intruders in the guardhouse![AN]
All guards, report to the upper level[N]
immediately! Don't let those rats escape![AN][ClearFace]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]Damn, the alarm's been raised.[AN]
Watch your toes, men, the guards will[N]
be coming up from all of those stairs.[AN]
Hurry, we need to flee before[N]
Count Sanz sees our faces.[A][X]

## ChA1GeraldoReappearsDialogue
[ML][LoadGeraldo]
[ML]Mercs, you heard the man![AN]
Everyone converge on those pirates[N]
to earn your wretched keep![A][X]

## ChA1SanzOrlandoAppearDialogue
[FL][LoadYurena][L][LoadSanz][MR][LoadOrlando]
[L]What in blazes is going on in there?![AN]
[MR]Count Sanz, sir, please stay back![AN]
A gang of dangerous thieves is rampaging[N]
inside, tearing the place apart.[AN]
[L]I won't stand for this! Yurena, get in[N]
there and mince those thieves to bits![AN]
[FL]As you command, milord.[AN]
[MR]No![AN]
[L]Sir Orlando?[AN]
[MR]Eh, it's uh - it would be dangerous to[N]
open this door and send Yurena away.[AN]
With these thieves abound, it'd be prudent[N]
to keep her by your side for safety.[AN]
[L]Gah, but they're getting away[N]
with my hard-earned treasure![AN]
[MR]No amount of gold can replace[N]
a human life, Count Sanz.[AN]
That's uh, one of the guild's creeds![AN]
I shudder to think of what torture you'd[N]
suffer at the hands of those scoundrels.[AN]
Let's just stay here and wait for[N]
everything to boil over.[A][X]

## ChA1YurenaWarpDialogue
[FL][LoadYurena][L][LoadSanz][MR][LoadOrlando]
[L]Gah, I can't take this anymore![AN]
Yurena, prepare yourself![AN]
[FR]As you command, milord.[AN]
[MR]Sir? Sir, what are you doing?![AN]
I told you it wasn't safe to open[N]
the door and send Yurena inside![AN]
//[L]I could open the door, or I[N]
//could use the Warp staff![AN]
[L]Ah, but I'm not going to open the door.[AN]
With the arcane power of this Warp staff[N]
I own, I can remain safe here.[AN]
[MR]Yes, but-[AN]
[L]Yurena! Hope you beat[N]
your old record![A][X]
