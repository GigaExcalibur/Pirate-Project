Loot, Escape[X]

## ChA1StatusObjective
Recover the relic,[N]
escape guardhouse.[X]

## ChA1BeginningScene1
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]This is the place. Desiderio,[N]
any sign of our shaman liaison?[AN]
[ML]Not that I can see. What's[N]
our course of action, Captain?[AN]
[MR]Damn, I can't stand sitting here[N]
twiddling our thumbs waiting.[AN]
Scout the perimeter, men! Let's[N]
scope our entry and exit points.[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene2
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse's outer walls[N]
are chipped in a few places.[AN]
A stiff breeze - or a quick chop[N]
of an axe - could break it down.[AN]
We have the back door, but this is[N]
another place to get in and out.[AN]
[MR]Let's count our lucky stars[N]
Count Sanz is a big cheapskate.[AN]
If he didn't want us to kick his walls[N]
in, he should've maintained them better.[AN]
Anything else catch your eye?[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene3
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse connects to other[N]
buildings in the east and south.[AN]
[MR]MENTOR taught me this one.[AN]
East is the Merchant Faire auction hall,[N]
and south are the nobles' quarters.[AN]
House Sanz owns the place, and they[N]
rent it out to auctioneers and bidders.[AN]
[ML]Can we get out through either?[AN]
[MR]Doubtful. The auction hall is heavily[N]
patrolled by security guards right now,[AN]
and the nobles all have personal[N]
bodyguards that'd rip us apart.[AN]
The only way to escape is fleeing north[N]
and losing them under cover of darkness.[AN]
[FFL]HEY![A] You two, over here![A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene4
[FFL][LoadIndio]
[R][LoadDesiderio]
[FR][LoadLua]
[FFL][MoFL]
[FL]Hello hello, MENTOR's Pirates![AN]
Name's Indio Medina, a shaman[N]
from the island of Balinoko.[AN]
Sorry I'm late, my legs are always[N]
too slow to keep up with my mind.[AN]
Now then, let's start the briefing![N]
On the east side of the guardh-[AN]
[R]You're too late, kid. We already[N]
scouted out the perimeter.[AN]
[FR]And since when were we [0x93]MENTOR's Pirates?[0x94][N]
Name's Lua, and I'm the captain here.[AN]
We were told you'd fill us in on[N]
the details of MENTOR's plan.[AN]
[FL]Right! First of all, I'm doing this[N]
because MENTOR is providing cover.[AN]
Count Sanz is notoriously paranoid[N]
about his treasure being stolen.[AN]
MENTOR's job is to keep him distracted[N]
while you guys recover the relic.[AN]
[R]But the guardhouse is still[N]
heavily guarded, correct?[AN]
[FL]Right again! The Count's hired some mercs[N]
to bolster his regular guard regime.[AN]
We'll need to punch through them[N]
to reach the relic stored within.[AN]
[FR]What do you mean, [0x93]we?[0x94][AN]
[FL]Oh, did I not mention that yet?[AN]
MENTOR and the village elder gave me[N]
permission to go on this mission too![AN]
Oh! Only if it's okay with you,[N]
your captainness.[AN]
[FR][Beat]
[R]Your decision, Captain Lua?[AN]
[FR]We can't look a gift shark in the mouth.[AN]
You're free to join us, Indio, but it's[N]
not fun and games. We all pull our weight.[AN]
[FL]You got it! I'll try harder than anyone's[N]
ever tried, you can count on that![AN]
[FR]Fantastic. In that case[Beat] Desiderio,[N]
you're on babysitting duty.[AN]
[R]What?! Don't just pawn them off on me![A][X]

## ChA1InformObjectiveDialogue
[ML][LoadIndio][MR][LoadLua]
[ML]Our target is that northeast chest.[AN]
[MR]That's the one with your island's relic?[AN]
[ML]Yep yep. You can tell cause Count Sanz's[N]
guard captains are the ones keeping watch.[AN]
[MR]You heard that, men? Once we nab that[N]
chest, run like hell out of here.[AN]
Steal everything that isn't nailed down,[N]
and make sure we [Red]leave no man behind[Red].[A][X]

## ChAICarmenIndioTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadIndio][MR][LoadCarmen]
[ML]Wow! That's quite the fiddle you've got.[AN]
[MR]Aw, thank you! I'm glad someone around[N]
here can appreciate perfect craftsmapship.[AN]
It's an Arriortúan, after all.[AN]
[ML]Hm? Arriortúan, you say? Can I[N]
see that for just a second?[AN]
[MR][MoL]
[ML][MoMR]
[ML]Oh yeah, now that I'm looking at[N]
it up close I can see the flaws.[AN]
You see, Arriortúa was an Incendivis[N]
artisan obsessed with local instruments.[AN]
He ripped off their designs, but was[N]
never able to make them sound the same.[AN]
He cheaped out on the wood and strings,[N]
making them too thin and too matted.[AN]
By chance has the crew ever complained[N]
about the way your fiddle sounded?[AN]
[MR]Um[Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh, also, now that I'm thinking about it.[AN]
After he retired, I heard Arriortúa took up[N]
a position tutoring young nobles in magic.[AN]
If his work on violins is anything, I hope[N]
those kids unlearn his improper techniques.[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh! Here's your instrument back, I'm sorry[N]
for going on such a long rant just now.[AN]
[ML][MoR]
[R][MoML]
[R]Anyway, I've got to get back to it.[N]
Maybe you can play for me sometime. See you![AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]Damn it, Arriortúa! It's your blasted[N]
fault nobody here appreciates my talents.[A][X]

## ChA1GeraldoLeavesDialogue
[ML][LoadLeandra][MR][LoadGeraldo]
[ML]Gerry, what the hell are we doing here?[AN]
[MR]What do you mean, Leandra?[AN]
[ML]We're being paid peanuts to stand around[N]
a dark room and watch over some boxes.[AN]
A guard said there's more gold in one[N]
chest than we'd see in our whole lives.[AN]
[MR]So? Work's work, isn't it?[AN]
[ML]That's not the point, and you know it.[AN]
You'd think a man of such wealth'd be[N]
willing to pay a little more to protect it.[AN]
[MR]Stuff it. Right now, Count Sanz is[N]
the man putting food in our bellies.[AN]
[ML]Yeah, barely. Just think, Gerry![AN]
If we took just a fraction of this[N]
room's gold, we could eat like kings![AN]
[MR]Yeah, as your last meal before[N]
they hang you for burglary.[AN]
I'm gonna go do some rounds through[N]
the underground tunnels now.[AN]
Standing around here is gonna make[N]
my legs get stiff.[AN]
If you need me, just holler and I'll[N]
come up from some other staircase.[AN][ClearFace]
[ML]You're too shortsighted, Gerry.[AN]
Just think of how much we could make[N]
without licking the boots of House Sanz.[A][X]

## ChA1LuaLeandraTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]You, sellsword. If you know what's good[N]
for you, you'll turn tail and leave now.[AN]
[MR]Oh believe me, I already know[N]
this job is no good for me.[AN]
But Count Sanz is the one paying,[N]
so he's the one I'm serving[Beat][AN]
Unless someone was willing to[N]
match his offer, I'd say.[AN]
[ML]He's holding out on you, then?[AN]
[MR]Damn straight! You know how much[N]
he's paying each of us mercs?[AN]
3000 gold! That's a blasted drop in[N]
the gallons of funds he makes![AN]
Just think of what I could do with[N]
his kind of luxury.[AN]
[ML][Beat]
[MR]But of course, that'll have to[N]
wait until we're done here.[AN]
What's your call, lady? You gonna[N]
recognize how much I'm worth?[A][X]

## ChA1DesiderioLeandraTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadDesiderio][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]What the- Leandra? Is that you?[AN]
[MR]Desiderio?! Are my eyes[N]
playing tricks on me?[AN]
I haven't seen you since we[N]
were mates in the Roseblades.[AN]
I see you've been keeping well,[N]
plundering an armed guardhouse.[AN]
[ML]I could say the same about you, Leandra.[AN]
I thought working as a grunt for House[N]
Sanz would be beneath someone like you.[AN]
[MR]Alas, merc work is drying up these days,[N]
what with Incendivis' expansion and all.[AN]
[ML]You could never work an honest[N]
living a day in your life.[AN]
[MR]Calling the kettle black, mate?[AN]
I thought you of all people would[N]
understand my situation.[AN]
[MR]I do. And because I do, I'm offering[N]
you a spot in my new crew.[AN]
It'll be just like old times.[AN]
[MR]Old times don't pay the tab, Desiderio.[AN]
You want my services, I need a bit of[N]
insurance in case this job goes south.[AN]
3000 gold'll suffice.[A][X]

## ChA1LeandraRecruitPrompt
[ML][LoadActive][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]Should I hire Leandra for 3000 gold?[AN]
[Yes][X]

## ChA1LeandraRecruitedDialogue
[ML][LoadActive][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]You've got a deal. Welcome[N]
to the crew, Leandra.[AN]
[MR]Glad at least you've got a lick of sense.[AN]
Now then, if you don't mind, I've got to[N]
break the news to my old employer.[A][X]
