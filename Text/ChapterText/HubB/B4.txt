Guess you ain't heard.[.4] This town's[N]
had a change of management.[AN]
And the new management don't take[N]
kindly to strangers just wandering in.[A]

Looks like a gang of ruffians has moved[N]
in, Lua.[.4] It doesn't seem worth the fuss.[A]

You're right.[.4] I don't like it, but[N]

Bad news Lua,[.4] I just spotted[N]

They're probably on their way here[N]
to deal with the bandits themselves.[A]

[MR][3LB]
Could this day go any more wrong?[.4][N]
We'll just have to finish and get[N]
out of here as fast as we can.[A]

I think that's the lot of them.[.4][N]
I thought that would never end.[A]

[MR][LoadGreagorLibrarianB][2LB]
Traveller![.4] I cannot thank you enough[N]
for ridding us of these bandits.[AN]
I am the mayor of our little oasis.[.4][N]
Who are you?[.4] Incendivis mercenaries?[A]

[ML][2LB]
Hah-[.4] Nothing like that,[.4][N]
[Beat] To be honest,[.4] we're pirates.[AN]
We were here to trade for goods,[.4][N]
but we weren't expecting brigands.[A]

[MR][3LB]
Unfortunately, being one of the few[N]
prosperous towns this far out makes[N]
us a ripe target for criminal sorts.[AN]
They moved in a week and a half ago and[N]
slaughtered our guard.[.4] No Incendivis[N]
to protect us this far out, I'm afraid.[AN]
They were extorting us for everything we[N]
had,[.4] so it's a good thing you came along[N]
miss.[.4] Pirates or no,[.4] you have our gratitude.[A]

[ML][3LB]
I'm glad for that at least.[.4] Being a pirate[N]
may not be the most moral,[.4] but extorting[N]
innocent villagers is just low beyond low.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Indeed[Beat] Oh, but I'm forgetting myself![N]
You must be exhausted from the battle,[N]
but consider our town at your service.[AN]
We can tend to your crew's wounds,[N]
or we can prepare a meal if you'd like.[AN]
Not that we have much to cook with,[N]
given the circumstances, but-[A]

[ML][3LB]
We're flattered, really,[.4][N]
but there's an Incendivis ship nearby,[N]
and unfortunately, we're on the run.[AN]
If we stick around, I doubt they'll[N]
be as gracious for our help as you.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Well,[.4] I know not the circumstances[N]
of your wanted status, but I care not.[AN]
You are clearly a crew of moral fiber[Beat][.5][AN]

We have two other ships waiting[N]

Now that's the part you should be[N]
impressed by Lex, with how thoroughly[N]
they kicked our asses back there.[AN]

[L][2LB]
As typical for many of the blowhards[N]
that tried to mess with us in the past.[AN]
We only wanted to trade with the town,[N]
only to find it overrun with your gang.[AN]
It's real low to be part of a place[N]
that was extorting a town like that.[AN]

[FR]
[Beat]Well, yeah, Javier was a[N]
real piece of work, I'll say that.[AN]
Always fantasized himself to be a king,[N]

[Beat][CloseEyes]Fair enough, sis.[AN]

Look captain, me and my bro will be front;[.5][N]
we've jumped from gang to gang a lotta times.[AN]

Keep in mind that, in spite of our flag,[N]
I'm not running things like a gang.[AN]
I won't tolerate any behaviors of[N]
the sort as a part of my crew.[AN]

[FR][2LB][OpenEyes]
Well duh, it all really just boiled down to[N]
not wanting getting cleaved in the head.[AN]
We'll be on our good behavior outside[N]
of any fight or brawl you throw us in.[AN]
[Beat]Though, some liquor would be nice too.[AN]

[FL][3LB]
We don't carry alcohol on-board.[AN]
Might not be what you expect[N]
from pirates, but that's just[N]
how the good captain runs things.[AN]
If we manage to make it to a[N]
port, then you can drink there.[AN]

[FR][2LB]

those back scratches then.[AN]

port, I'll just go to a bar and--)[AN]

trying to smuggle some aboard.[AN]

these guys in a serious matter.[AN]
At least, while we're not[N]

[MR]
[Beat]You got that right, sis.[AN]
Let's just see where we're[N]

If we look out for the both of them, then[N]
I think the other will be happy.[AN]
That's what I felt when you took me[N]
