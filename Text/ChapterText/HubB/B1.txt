Ah,[.4] Captain![.4][N]
Do you have a moment?[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
What's on your mind Razvan?[A]

[MidRight][3LB]
Well, since we're on the outskirts[N]
I've been thinking. This place isn't too[N]
far out from my hometown.[AN]
I travelled around a bit in my[N]
time here and there's a village nearby[N]
where I remember rumors of treasure.[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
Is that so?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
Indeed.[.5] It was[Beat][.4] a while ago[N]
but perhaps it's worth investigating?[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
Do you know anything about this treasure?[A]

[MidRight][3LB]
Truth be told I can't remember much.[.5][N]
But I remember hearing it was[N]
riches and weapons in a desert ruin.[AN]
But it seems like it could be real,[.5][N]
I mean the desert hides many treasures.[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
I suppose a lead is a lead.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadRazvan]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Alright,[.4] seems like a reasonable[N]
idea.[.5] We could use the funds.[AN]
Do you still remember the way?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
Somewhat,[.4] though we'll need to[N]
find some clues about the treasure.[A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Well it's not like we're above[N]
a little investigative work.[AN]
Go talk to Pilar and see about[N]
charting us a course there.[A]

Right away captain![A]

[MidRight]
W-What, are you crazy?![AN]
Y-You can't go out there, the[N]
sand wyverns will eat you up![AN]

[FL]
[Beat]Sand wyverns?[AN]

[L]
First time we're hearing of[N]
this from who we've talked to[Beat][AN]
We're capable of handling wild wyverns;[N]
already dealt with a couple of riders.[AN]

[MR]
B-But they hunt in packs here![AN]
Imagine, baking in the heat, too[N]
exhausted to run at all[Beat][AN]
You see a shadow approaching[N]
out of nowhere and...[AN][MoMR]
Chomp![.5] Snuffed out![AN]

[FL]
[Beat]And do you think us foolish[N]
enough to travel in the desert sun?[AN]
Wyverns have poor night vision, and[N]
we'd travel near dusk regardless. [AN]
They'll be of no threat.[AN]

[MR]
But they'd just smell you![AN]
[Beat][.5]Then again, you all are[N]
sailors, maybe that smell wouldn't--[AN]

[L][1LB]
[HalfCloseEyes]And what do you mean by that[Beat]?[AN]

[Beat][AN]
I-I'm just going to go now[Beat][AN][CSS]

Our investigation has yet[N]
to bear any sort of fruit.[AN]

A pilgrim? [A]N-No sir, I'm a sailor.[N]
Would you happen to know--[AN]

[MR][3LB]
I remember my pilgrimages to[N]
monumental sites on the isles![AN]
Oh yes, they were a spiritual[N]
awakening, enlightening me on[N]
the world that you and I live on.[AN]
Through the mountains, the desert,[N]
the rain, the snow[Beat][.4]it was[N]
tough, but I endured it all![AN]
Even if we fell into The Lands Below,[N]
my faith in what is beyond would[N]
keep me comforted in my last moments[Beat][AN]

I'd say at this point it's unlikely[N]

apologizing, Captain Lua.[AN]
I brought everyone all[N]

Hey, hey.[A] Desiderio is out trying[N]
to find any sort of shop here.[AN]
It won't completely solve our[N]
issues, but it'll ease the burden.[AN]
It was worth a shot coming[N]
here just for that alone.[AN]

Let's just enjoy a night at a[N]

[FR][LoadRazvan]

[L][1LB]
Oh?[.5] And who might you be?[A]

[Right][2LB]
I'm Dmitr.[.5] I heard you asking[N]
around about those treasure rumors.[AN]
I have spent much time in the[N]
desert, I am willing to be your guide.[A]

[FL][2LB]
Is that so?[AN]
What's in it for you?[AN]
Why haven't you claimed[N]
the treasure for yourself?[AN]
We're all for chasing rumors,[N]
but it sounds a bit suspect.[AN]

[R][3LB]
I ask for payment for my services.[AN]
People speak of vengeful spirits[N]
inhabiting those ruins and none,[.4][N]
even I,[.4] dare set foot there.[AN]
But for the right price, and with your[N]
party in tow,[.4] I could be swayed.[AN]

[L][2LB]
I see[Beat] Well, I don't know[N]
about vengeful spirits,[AN]
but we certainly can't find our[N]
way around the desert on our own.[AN]
What's your fee for your guidance?[A]

[R][2LB]
A cut of the treasure itself[N]
should suffice for me.[A]

[L][2LB]
Acceptable terms for me.[AN]

[FR]
Wait[Beat]first, where's Desiderio?[AN]
Before we head out, we should[N]
go ahead and find him first.[AN]

[FL]
There's no need to.[AN]
[Beat]He's walking down the[N]
road above as we speak.[AN]
Even out here in open, I[N]
can hear him just as well.[AN]

I about started an argument with[N]
the shopkeeper when I heard that.[AN]
Should've asked Orlando to be[N]
doing all of this instead.[AN]
[Beat]But who's this guy?[AN]
You manage to find a guide?[AN]

[R]
Indeed; I'm Dmitr.[AN]
I know the location of the[N]
ruins your crew hopes to see.[AN]
What these ruins used to[N]
be, I'm clueless on[Beat][AN]
But, I am sure it still[N]
contains valuables.[AN]

[ToggleSmile]Ha![A] Knew the boy had some[N]
sort of lead all along.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Well, I'm happy to put trust in my crew.[AN]
How far away are the ruins?[AN]

Only an hour away.[AN]
Though the sun sets soon enough,[N]
we will have enough time to explore[N]

be able to see it soon.[A]

We can't be out here[N]
too long though.[.4][AN]
It'll be freezing once[N]
it gets really dark.[AN]

[MR][2LB]
I think I see it in the distance.[.5][N]
Only a half hour more at most.[A]

[ML][2LB]
Good.[.5] I don't think I want to[N]

You hear the boss?[AN]
Another hour of[N]
walking on sand[Beat][.5][AN]
[CloseEyes]A real treat to me[N]
and my heavy plate.[AN][OpenEyes]

[MR]
Well, you should be glad that[N]
you aren't slow-cooking in there.[AN]
Maybe if we stick around too long,[N]
you'll instead be an icicle.[AN]

[FL]
Seems like the real problem is[N]
staying steady on the sand[Beat][AN]
I can tell you're not really[N]
comfortable walking here.[AN]

[L]
I'm plenty used to the metal boots[Beat][.5][N]
on a stable surface, not this crap.[AN]
Switch it up to a bunch of coarse,[N]
rough particles, and it's trickier.[AN]
I can do this, but I'm not[N]
having fun while doing so.[AN]

[MR]
Please.[A] You just need to have[N]
a more careful step in the sand.[AN]
Do it in a way so you don't sink[N]
down as much, make each step easier.[AN]

[L]
Armor's weight is going to naturally[N]
just sink me in further.[AN]
How about you try being nimble and[N]
fleet-footed while having this on?[AN]
Raz, you're invited to try it too.[AN]

[FL]
N-No thank you, Desiderio.[AN]
Still[Beat]to think we'll be[N]
spending a night out here.[AN]
Do you all think T.O.R.C.H[N]
will catch wind of us?[AN]


[MR]
With a village this isolated from[N]
the main isles, its unlikely.[AN]
The winds don't flow near here.[AN]
We might even be the first visitors[N]
they've had in practically weeks.[AN]

[L]
Explains why the people[N]
here are so damn antsy[Beat][AN]
Rumors will spread, and I'm sure[N]
another ship will take those rumors.[AN]
By the time that happens though, we'll[N]
hopefully be long away to the unknown.[AN]

[FL]
Just as it was when I was[N]
growing up, always so quiet[Beat][AN]
Even a single ship showing up[N]
at the docks would be a surprise.[AN]
It's always strange to match[N]
that quietness now and again.[AN]

[MR]
Maybe we should go and get[N]
attacked by sand wyverns.[AN]
That would certainly make[N]
things a little less quiet.[AN]

[FL]
Sand wyverns?[A] What are--[AN]

[FFR]
Do you all want to[N]
freeze back there?[AN]
Keep up the pace![AN]

[FL][MoFL]
Oops![A] S-Sorry, Captain Lua![AN]
Seems like we got carried away[N]
talking instead of walking[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Let's keep on moving.[AN]
If you need a hand trudging through[N]
the sand Desiderio, I don't mind.[AN]

[L]
Hey,[.4] I'll be fine![AN]
Don't need to be babied around[N]
the desert like a blind dog.[AN]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Appreciate the offer though.[AN][X]

You hear the boss?[AN]
Another hour of[N]
walking on sand[Beat][.5][AN]
[CloseEyes]A real treat to[N]
my horse, I bet.[AN]

[MR]
With all the armor you[N]
and the horse have on?[AN]
I don't doubt it[Beat]at least[N]
you're not getting slow cooked.[AN]

[FL]
This has me curious though[Beat][AN]
Desiderio, haven't you been fighting[N]
for more than a decade by now?[AN]
What had you decide to pick up[N]
the saddle and fight on horseback?[AN]

[L]
[CloseEyes]Hmph, call me an old geezer[N]
while you're at it, boy[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
But, I supposed it was time[N]
to get my feet a proper break.[AN]
I've picked up enough on steeds[N]
know how to properly care for one.[AN]
Seems like it's been paying off,[N]
being able to take point quicker.[AN]

[MR]
Convenient that the Igniswords' ship[N]
had plenty of mounts to spare.[AN]
Not a bad idea to take the opportunity,[N]
I wonder if others will do the same.[AN]

[FL]
Unfortunately, I don't think[N]
your steed expected the sand[Beat][AN]
It seems pretty antsy walking[N]
through the rough terrain.[AN]

[MR]
Can't say I have much advice on[N]
easing traversal for your horse.[AN]

[L]
Yeah, feel sorry for the big guy[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Hmm[Beat][AN][MoL]
Don't worry boy[Beat]Rahel has[N]
a bunch of apples on the ship[Beat][AN]
Once we get back, I'll give some[N]
of them as a treat for your work.[AN]
(Wonder if this sort of thing is[N]
what Ernie felt with his beast[Beat])[AN]

[FL]
Once we get back, indeed[Beat][AN]
To think we'll be spending[N]
a night out in that village.[AN]
Do you all think T.O.R.C.H[N]
will catch wind of us?[AN]

Oops![A] S-Sorry Captain Lua![AN]
Seems like we got carried away[N]
talking instead of walking[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Or trotting, in Desiderio's case.[AN]
I'd offer to lend a hand Desiderio,[N]
but not much I can do to help the horse.[AN]

[FL]
If you want me to, I could lead the way.[AN]
I didn't visit the desert much, but my mother[N]
still taught me what firmer sand looks like.[AN]
It might make it easier on our feet[Beat][.6][N]
[ToggleSmile]A-And of course, the hooves.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Huh, you're able to[N]
tell the difference?[AN]

[CloseEyes]All lives that were led by my cousin.[AN]

Yes. Before my wandering days, I caught[N]

So long as I have room and board,[N]
that is enough for me.[A]

we could always use more bodies.[AN]
I should tell you though this is[N]

No problem, I'd figured you were.[AN]
You all seem friendlier than most gangs[N]
