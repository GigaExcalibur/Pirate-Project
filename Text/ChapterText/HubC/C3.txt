So, this is the whole group.[A][N]
A-as you can see, you and your crew[N]
make up most of our numbers.[A][N]
I managed to get a few friends[N]
to help out, but[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Trust me, this sort of imbalance[N]
is nothing new to us.[A][N]
As long as we get paid at the end[N]
of this, there's no problem here.[A]
[MidRight]
Ah, that's good. I was talking with[N]
a few mercenaries, but[TMM]--[TMM][A][N]
Speak of the devil.[N]
Here they are again.[A]

[Left][LoadBoru]
[Right][LoadRima]
[FarRight][LoadBolton]
[Right][MoveRight]
Hey, what gives?! We weren't good[N]
enough for you or something?![A]
[FarRight]
Aw, you're overthinking it.[N]
The more, the merrier is what I say![A][N]
Keeps the risk from getting too[N]
high, don't you think?[A]
[Right][3LB]
Yeah, but how are we supposed[N]
to get out of this place if we[N]
don't have the coin?[A][N]
We can't get paid if our job gets[N]
taken right from under us, Bolton![A]
[Left]
W-well, I didn't feel comfortable[N]
paying you for your asking price.[A][N]
[Beat]And I still don't, to be honest.[A][N]
I'm paying this pirate crew more,[N]
but they have sheer numbers to[N]
sweeten the deal, at least.[A][N]
But if you want to tag along[N]
for a much lower reward,[N]
I'm open to negotiating.[A]
[FarRight][2LB][MoveFarRight]
As am I! Some coin is much,[N]
much better than none.[A][N]
Isn't that right, Rima?[A]
[Right][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[FarRight][3LB]
Let's all take that as a [OQ]yes".[A][N]
If 6,000 altogether is too much[N]
to ask, how about 3,000?[A]
[Left][1LB]
Still too high. 1,000.[A]
[FarRight][2LB]
What about 2,000?[A]
[Left][1LB]
1,500[Beat]W-wait, 1,600.[A]
[Right][2LB]
Why did you[Beat]never mind.[N]
Alright, I can agree to 1,600.[A]
[FarRight][2LB]
If we're all on the same page,[N]
then we've got a contract![A][N]
Bolton and Rima are at your[N]
service, Mister Boru.[A]
[Left][3LB]
J-just Boru is fine. We should [N]
get started with the mission.[A][N]
You two can stay by our backlines[N]
and help out anyone that starts[N]
to lag too far behind.[A]
[X]

## HubC_3Intro3
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidRight][LoadBoru]
That turned out well. Now we've got[N]
two more fighters on our side.[A][N]
We probably have the numbers over[N]
Salman, but better safe than sorry.[A]
[MidLeft]
How did this whole situation[N]
with Salman happen, anyways?[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
Well, it's built up over[N]
these last few months.[A][N]
Quispe is doing their best,[N]
but nobody's best could[N]
truly replace Wayra.[A][N]
I didn't think anything big[N]
would happen, but that was[N]
before the other day, when[Beat][A]
[X]

## HubC_3Flashback1
[MidLeft][LoadSalman][3LB]
Thank you all for coming[N]
on such short notice.[N]
I know it's getting late.[A][N]
I'll try to make this as[N]
quick as I can, but[Beat][N]
bear with me.[A]
[CSS]
[MidLeft]
Ever since Wayra's passed, it's been[N]
quiet around the village.[A][N]
Even those blasted pirates haven't[N]
shaken things up much.[A][N]
It's only these past fews days[N]
that've started to get lively,[N]
thanks to Quispe.[A][N]
They're beginning to fill the[N]
empty space that Wayra left behind.[A][N]
There's nothing inherently wrong[N]
with that, of course.[A][N]
But we wouldn't be here if that[N]
was the end of the story, would we?[A][N]
All those back-and-forths with[N]
Wayra[Beat][A][N]
all those days and nights of them[N]
[OQ]watching" our village's shrine[N]
when there were already guards about[Beat][A][N]
and now, all of these new friends[N]
Quispe's made so suddenly?[A][N]
The rest of the village may think[N]
otherwise, but we know not to trust them.[A][N]
They're up to something, and it all[N]
comes back to the shrine.[A][N]
If they make a move now, we don't[N]
have numbers on our side yet.[A][N]
Besides, Quispe is a stubborn one.[N]
Even if we knew for sure what they're[N]
planning, I doubt they'll back down.[A][N]
[CSS]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I only see one way[N]
to resolve this.[A][N]
We get more of the village on[N]
our side, and then we claim[N]
the shrine for ourselves.[A][N]
We take whatever the shrine[N]
contains and get it away[N]
from Quispe.[A][N]
I may be suggesting the very[N]
thing I'm warning of, but I[N]
trust everyone present.[A][N]
I know we can all keep each[N]
other in check, for the sake[N]
of the village.[A][N]
If you know of anyone that[N]
you have that much trust[N]
in, seek them out.[A][N]
If you cannot convince them,[N]
I'll try my best.[A][N]
[CSS]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]That's everything.[N]
Be careful, everyone.[A][N]
May Wayra watch over us,[N]
even now.[A][CSS]
[X]

## HubC_3Flashback2
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
[MidRight][LoadBoru]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So, Salman still doesn't[N]
trust me.[A][N]
And several others, by the[N]
sound of things.[A][N]
Thank you for informing[N]
me, Boru.[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
I-I know I should've trusted[N]
you from the beginning, but[N]
Salman lured me in real good.[A][N]
Whenever you did something we[N]
didn't agree with, he'd always[N]
bring up Wayra.[A][N]
He[Beat]he made me miss the way[N]
things used to me.[A][N]
[Beat]But after that speech last night,[N]
I know things can't be the same.[A][N]
And even though Wayra's not with[N]
us anymore, I know he wouldn't[N]
approve of what Salman's doing.[A]
[MidLeft]
I wholeheartedly agree.[A][N]
To not only divide our flock like[N]
this, but to suggest taking the[N]
shrine's power away from us[Beat][A][N]
This is a grave matter, indeed.[N]
Do you know of any that have[N]
joined him since last night?[A]
[MidRight][2LB]
No, you're the first person I've[N]
really talked with since then.[A]
[MidLeft]
I see. We must act quickly to[N]
root out this treachery.[A][N]
Boru, I want you to take anyone that[N]
you trust and head to their hideout.[A][N]
Seize Salman and anyone that's still[N]
helping him.[A][N]
If he isn't there, determine his[N]
whereabouts with haste.[A][N]
Once you've done that, bring the[N]
traitors to the Cave of Whispers.[A][N]
I will explain the situation to[N]
the guards.[A]
[MidRight][1LB]
You want m-me to do this?[A]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Of course. You deserve a chance[N]
to prove yourself.[A][N]
Be careful with who you ask[N]
for help, however.[A][N]
If you have trouble finding help,[N]
those odd mercenaries may still[N]
be in the village.[A][N]
Getting outsiders like them could[N]
be safer than trying to decipher[N]
allegiances within our flock.[A][N]
I wish you the best of luck, Boru.[A][CSS]
[X]

## HubC_3Intro4
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidRight][LoadBoru]
[MidLeft]
Sounds like you've got a lot of[N]
pressure on your shoulders.[A]
[MidRight]
That may be, but I'll do my best.[N]
[Beat]No, I must do my best.[A][N]
Quispe is[TMM]--[TMM] er, everyone back in[N]
the village is counting on me.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Isn't this whole mission being kept[N]
in the dark from almost everyone?[A]
[MidRight][2LB]
O-oh yeah. Whoops[Beat][A][N]
[MoveMidRight]
O-oh! We're here. What, um,[N]
interesting timing![A][N]
Shall we, Captain?[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Sounds like their wyvern's[N]
not the only one I should be[N]
threatened by.[A][N]
Better keep that in mind if[N]
we're gonna stay in the[N]
village's good graces.[A][CSS]
[X]

## HubC_3Intro5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPirate]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJasper]
Let's see what kind of loot[N]
we can get from here.[A][N]
Tell the boss that we're[N]
kicking things off![A][CSS]

## HubC_3Intro6
[FarLeft][LoadLua]
[Left][LoadBoru]
[Right][LoadBolton]
[FarRight][LoadRima]
[Right]
Well, that was easy. Now we just[N]
have to track down Salman.[A]
[Left]
We don't have to go far, I think.[A][N]
He has a sleeping spot away[N]
from the cave.[A]
[FarLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Boru, did you really bring my[N]
crew all the way out here just to[N]
seize these four individuals?[A]
[Left]
H-hey, we're not done yet![N]
Once we get Salman, that'll be[N]
FIVE individuals![A][N]
Besides, you're the second line[N]
of defense if these guys somehow[N]
get away from my friends.[A][N]
We've got a l-long trip back, so[N]
keep your guard up.[A]
[FarRight][1LB]
[Beat]Hey, do you guys hear that?[A]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Maybe things will get interesting,[N]
after all. Let's have a look.[A][CSS]
[X]

## HubC_3Intro7
[FarLeft][LoadLua]
[Left][LoadBoru]
[Right][LoadBolton]
[FarRight][LoadRima]
[Left][1LB]
Not these guys again[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Ah, must be those pirates[N]
Quispe mentioned earlier.[A]
[Left][3LB]
We've put down smaller crews in the[N]
past, but this one's a different story.[N]
Their numbers seem endless somehow.[A]
[FarLeft]
I suppose your excessive, ah,[N]
caution, paid off in the end.[N]
Anyways, just leave them to us.[A][N]
We'll need to make two paths[N]
past these guys: one for[N]
Salman, and one for the exit.[A]
[FarRight][2LB]
I'll scout ahead and make sure that[N]
[OQ]exit" is something we can use.[A]
[FarLeft][1LB]
All by yourself?[A]
[Right][2LB]
When Rima puts her mind to something,[N]
you can expect good results.[A][N]
Let's leave her to her task and make[N]
sure things go smoothly here, aye?[A]
[FarLeft]
Very well, if you insist.[N]
Good luck out there, Rima.[A]
[FarRight]
Likewise, Captain. Bolton, don't[N]
overextend while I'm gone.[A]
[Right]
Don't worry. If it happens, it'll be[N]
hard for me to even try to do so.[A]

[MidRight][LoadBolton]
[MidLeft]
Care to fill me in on this[N]
mysterious [OQ]it"?[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
I'll be my best out there, Captain,[N]
but my, ah, stamina is rather poor.[N]
Ever since the day I was born, really.[A][N]
I've gotten better at riding my steed,[N]
but getting into drawn-out battles isn't[N]
exactly a strength of mine.[A][N]
I don't want to be a burden out there,[N]
so don't be surprised if I take off.[A][N]
Hopefully Rima will be back by the[N]
time I reach my limit.[A]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]Is whatever you took from[N]
our captives any good, at least?[A]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Hey, I'm not half bad at casting tomes![A][N]
And this hook I picked up seems a little[N]
old, but I bet its got some value.[A][N]
I just need to think over how to[N]
make the most of it[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Well, if you aren't going to use[N]
it, give it to someone that will.[A][N]
Might make a difference out here.[A]

Aye aye, Captain.[A]

## HubC_3Explanation
[ToggleRed]Win/Lose Information[ToggleRed][N]
The objective of this chapter is to[N]
escort the traitors off of the map.[A][N]
To do this, a player or NPC unit must[N]
escape on a blue tile on the left side[N]
of the map while rescuing a traitor.[A][N]
If a traitor isn't being carried, they[N]
will attempt to escape on a red tile[N]
on the right side of the map.[A][N]
A Game Over is triggered if a[N]
traitor escapes on a red tile.[A]
[X]

## HubC_3Explanation2
[ToggleRed]Miscellaneous Information[ToggleRed][N]
- Player units can only escape[N]
while rescuing a traitor.[A][N]
- Traitors can move through enemies[N]
and won't be attacked by them.[N]
However, they have 1 less Mov.[A]
[X]

## EarlyLeaveExplanation
[ToggleRed]Early Leave[ToggleRed][N]
In this chapter, Bolton's skill[N]
has unique properties.[A][N]
- If he is rescuing a traitor when[N]
he exits the map, the traitor will[N]
also leave.[A][N]
This counts as a successful escort.[A][N]
- Rima must be selected as the[N]
unit replacing Bolton.[A][N]
If Bolton is dead, Rima will still[N]
show up on Turn 5.[A]

I can't guarantee anything, but[N]
I'll at least hear you out.[A]

I'd gladly welcome you onboard, Rima.[A][N]

It's a little too late for[N]
pleasantries, don't you think?[A][N]
[MidRight]
[Beat]If we've reached that point,[N]

[MidLeft][3LB]
You can start with the names of[N]

[MidRight][3LB]
I cannot see your thoughts, but I[N]
know the secrets that have been[N]
passed down to us.[A][N]
Only a few others know exactly[N]
why guarding the shrine is such[N]
a great responsiblity.[A][N]
With Wayra gone, that's one less[N]
obstacle in the way of anyone that[N]
hungers for its power.[A][N]
And if a single story about the[N]
shrine is true, then[Beat]well,[N]
I fear for this world.[A][N]
I did what I could to save it,[N]
but it seems that I've been[N]
found wanting.[A][N]
I can only pray that karma will[N]
find its way to you.[A]

[Beat]You disappoint me. All these years[N]
of yours over me, and still you[N]
lack understanding.[A][N]
Well, it's a good thing that our[N]
flock has me guiding the way to[N]
a bright future.[A][N]
One that Wayra would never lead[N]
us to. One that will ensure our[N]
victory against Incendivis.[A][N]
We're done here, but I'll be back.[A][N]

at least more cooperative, when[N]
