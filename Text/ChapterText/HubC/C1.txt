[ML]
Wha- you? Again?[AN]
I thought I was finally[N]
done with your sorry lot![A]
[MR][3LB]
I wish I could say[N]
the same, Hermen.[AN]
Never before were any[N]
of our prisoners quite[N]
as[Beat] abrasive as you.[A]
[ML]
Abrasive? Perhaps for you.[AN]
But at times, Captain Lua's[N]
treatment almost makes me[N]
miss your ministrations.[A]
[MR][2LB]
I see she lets you[N]
carry a sword, now.[AN]
At least you can take[N]
bullets on the front line.[A]
[ML]
Yes. She does.[AN]
And I seem to have proven to[N]
be useful, if nothing else.[AN]
[Beat]We're going up against[N]
one[Beat] Count Sanz, are we not?[A]
[MR][3LB]
Yeah. We are. [ToggleSmile]And I suppose[N]
you'll help us cut him down.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Come to think of it,[AN]
didn't we find you in House Sanz[N]
territory in the first place?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Maybe so. It feels[N]
like a lifetime ago.[AN]
But [ToggleRed]I'd like to participate[N]
in the fight today[ToggleRed].[AN]
I have[Beat] [CloseEyes]some painful[N]
history with Count Sanz.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll not stand aside[N]
and swab the deck now.[A]
[MR]
I don't make the call on[N]
whether or not you're deployed.[AN]
But Captain Lua's soft.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]These days, she might[N]
even listen to your words.[A][ToggleSmile]

the captain of those brutes?[AN]
You know the treachery they've[N]
tried on us before, Biko.[A]
[ML]
I don't think they can[N]
try anything now, though.[AN]
Captain Lua is stronger than ever,[N]
and the Rioja Reapers are gone.[AN]
This [OpenQuote]Ruby" won't be claiming[N]
any debt of ours alone.[A]
[MR]
Debt of mine. And it sits[N]
ill with me, all the same.[A]
[MR][MoveFarRight]
[ML][ClearFace]
[R][LoadBiko]
[ML][LoadRuby]
[ML]
I see I've become the[N]
talk of the town, here.[AN]
Aren't you two the kids[N]
who owed Sagargala a loan?[A]
[FR]
He's dead. And none of[N]
us owe anything, anymore.[A]
[ML]
Dead at your hands. Don't[N]
think I don't know that.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]But he had it coming, and[N]
we still have work to do[OpenEyes].[A]
[FR]
Yeah. Captain Lua[N]
has a job for us.[AN]
C'mon, Biko. Let's get[N]
ready for the fight ahead.[A]
[FR][ClearFace]
[R][MoveMidRight]
[MR]
[Beat]Y'know, I do have to say[Beat][N]
[ToggleSmile]Thanks. Despite it all[ToggleSmile].[A]
[ML]
What are you thanking me for?[AN]
Me and mine tried to[N]
sell you like trade goods.[A]
[MR]
I know. But that's[N]
in the past, now.[AN]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]And you did save both[N]
of our lives, back then.[AN]
[CloseEyes]The dashing hero atop[N]
her mighty pirate ship[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I guess I'm still thankful[N]
that you brought us to freedom,[AN]
no matter what else your[N]
crew brought us ever since.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]A valiant hero[Beat][ToggleSmile] Hah. If[N]
only it could be that easy.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Go help your sister[N]
prepare for battle, kid.[AN]
[CloseEyes]You won't be getting any[N]
redemption out of me.[A][X]

[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadRuby]
[MR]
Gotta say, Captain Lua,[AN]
I never thought I'd be the[N]
one taking orders from you.[A]
[ML]
It must be strange, after spending[N]
your life bossing others around.[A]
[MR]
Strange isn't the word for[N]
it, Lua. Just[Beat] angry.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've lost my whole crew, and[N]
all my friends among them.[AN]
The only one willing to help me[N]
is the woman who killed Sagargala.[AN]
I've lost all my business, all[N]
my goals[Beat] [OpenEyes]save for revenge.[A]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Revenge, huh?[N]
I know the feeling.[AN]
[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]Still, I'm glad for your ship[N]
and your blade, Captain Ruby.[ToggleSmile][A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[ML]
[Beat]Though I have some things I'd[N]
like to know before we descend.[AN]
You didn't give us the full[N]
story back in the Rebel camp.[AN]
How did you learn that your[N]
[OpenQuote]Yurena" was in danger?[AN]
And what happened in your previous[N]
confrontation with House Sanz?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Let me explain.[AN]
She told me Sanz was chasing[N]
a treasure in this region,[AN]
so we trailed him down there.[AN]
Then, my first mate Lanzarote saw[N]
a burst of magical power[Beat][A][X]

[ToggleSmile]All of the value in this place,[N]

Not even for this.[A][OpenEyes]

Thank you for the warning,[N]

the guard on these outlying isles.[AN]
With his new power, the farther[N]

You said the Count had access[N]

We've had a run-in[N]

Escaped from 'em by the skin[N]

[MR][LoadLua]
The scale of your treasure?[N]

Yurena? Oh, the woman I[N]

The hands of your guards[N]

has it not?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadSanz]
Since you ran away from me,[N]

Since you lost yourself[N]
in debt to a pirate gang.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHermenegildo]
You don't quite seem[N]

I fled all this way[N]

Your cruelty eclipses even[N]
Captain Lua at her very worst.[AN]
And now that I've seen[N]

I'm not your bookworm[N]

[ML][LoadSanz]
You think you can speak to[N]
your own father that way?[AN]
You think you can steal away[N]

Enough of this foolishness.[AN]
You will lay down your arms[N]
and join your rightful master.[AN]
And if you try to raise a[N]

Your spells will not even[N]
scratch the power I now wield.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHermenegildo]
My spells? That's, ah[Beat][N]
that's not quite true anymore.[AN]
You see, Captain Lua forbade[N]

Just the barest salary[N]

Nah. Some things are worth[N]
a lot more than money.[AN]

Though your courage comes[N]

Where is your bodyguard?[AN]
I had thought you[N]

[ML][LoadSanz]
Oh, Yurena? I have no[N]

No need for Baltasar or the[N]

It's grounded, but Desiderio[N]

The way I see it, Lua[N]

We both found ways of life that[N]
worked for us and our crews,[AN]
no matter what our morals or[N]
the Empire had to say about it.[A]

That's definitely one way[N]

And yet you've stayed[N]

I think you need to know.[AN]
It's about Yurena. We[Beat][N]

[CloseEyes]Then that means she[Beat][N]
stayed behind after all.[AN]
There's no way she could've[N]
survived something like that[Beat][AN]
but who knows what happened[N]
inside the temple once we left?[A]

Though I wouldn't exactly[N]
consider you a [OpenQuote]friend".[A]
[MR][2LB]
And that's why I came back![AN]
No matter how awfully[N]
you choose to treat me,[AN]
you're somehow still better than[N]
everyone I've followed before.[AN]
I've made real friends here, too,[N]
and had chances to prove myself.[AN]
I'd like to not leave that behind.[AN]
[Beat]If that's alright[N]
with you, Captain Lua.[A]
[ML][2LB]
I'm not convinced you aren't[N]
just saving your own skin[Beat][AN]
but if you're sticking[N]
with us to the end,[AN]
that's all right with me.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Welcome back to the crew, Hermen.[A][X]

[MR]
Then that's,[N]
ah[Beat] that's it.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Father is gone for[N]
good, this time.[AN]
No longer there for me[N]
to run away from[Beat][AN]
no longer there for[N]
me to return to.[A]
[ML][LoadLua]
Hermen, you're spending an[N]
awful lot of time lingering,[AN]
instead of helping us[N]
clean up from the crash.[A]
[MR][MoveMidRight]
[MR][3LB]
[OpenEyes]Ah, Captain! I must sincerely[N]
apologize for making you wait.[AN]
I-I was just[Beat] overcome[N]
with emotion, after seeing[N]
your great victory-[A]
[ML]
You don't need to lie.[AN]
I heard what you said[N]
to Sanz at the temple.[AN]
Hard to believe that a[N]
castaway from Port Greagor[N]
has ancestry like that.[A]
[MR][2LB]
Captain Lua[Beat][AN]
On that note, I,[N]
er, I ought to ask,[AN]
does this mean that[N]
my debt is perhaps-[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Don't worry about it.[N]
You're free.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[ToggleSmile]T-truly?[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML][3LB]
When I first bought your[N]
debt, I thought it was a[N]
waste of good doubloons.[AN]
But you've more than proven your[N]
worth over these past months.[AN]
Not just as a servant, but[N]
as a member of my crew.[AN]
And now you were willing[N]
to fight your own father,[AN]
just for the sake of[N]
helping me win the day.[AN]
Do as you wish, Hermen. You've[N]
no need to follow me anymore.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[ToggleSmile]That's wonderful! Y-you have[N]
my eternal gratitude, Captain![AN]
Though given that choice, after[N]
everything I've been through[Beat][AN]
I'd like to stay on with[N]
the Skysabers after this.[A][ToggleSmile]
[ML]
Maybe you could try and-[AN]
Wait, what?[A]
[MR]
I certainly can't say that you[N]
and yours have been kind to me.[AN]
Rather the opposite, in fact![A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]That's certainly true.[A]
[MR][3LB]
But somehow, I've still felt[N]
better among your pirates[N]
than I have anywhere else.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Not that that's a particularly[N]
high bar for you to clear[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Still, I've made real friends here,[N]
and had chances to prove myself.[N]
I'd like to not leave that behind.[AN]
[Beat]If that's alright[N]
with you, Captain Lua.[A]
[ML]
Of course it is.[AN]
At this point, signing you[N]
on as a full crew member[N]
is just a formality.[AN]
If you need a tome, or[N]
anyone else's help,[N]
you know who to ask.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Welcome to the crew, Hermen.[A][X]
