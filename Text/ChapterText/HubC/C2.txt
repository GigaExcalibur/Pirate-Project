## C2_Synopsis_A
CURRENT SYNOPSIS OF C2[N]
(Feel free to skip!)[AN][Clear]
The Skysabers are attempting to[N]
purchase supplies in Keeper territory,[N]
going to a depot village to do so.[AN]
Little do they know, a large contingent[N]
of Blackhearts, commanded by another[N]
one of Alonso's co-captains, approaches.[AN]
There is a small retinue of imperials[N]
accompanying them, including the imperial[N]
captain met in A4, Calista. [AN]
However, the TORCH members are mostly[N]
fliers;[....] they were sent off to grab[N]
more supplies for this large party.[AN]

When the Blackheart warband sights the[N]
depot, their first instinct is[N]
to charge and plunder the village.[AN]
Calista opposes this plan, thanks to[N]
convincing from Valerie, the recruit[N]
initally found during A4 too.[AN]
Enraged by the captain shutting them[N]
down, they turn hostile.[AN]
Calista quickly rescues Valerie,[N]
and retreats toward the village.[AN]
Knowing the Blackhearts are relentless,[N]
Calista buys Valerie time to run by[N]
holding out in an old fort she sighted.[AN]
Valerie flees towards the village alone.[AN][X]

## C2_Synopsis_B
Lua attempts to haggle with the Keeper[N]
supplier, which also gets Orlando to[N]
throw in Pilar as a reason for a discount.[AN]
Before Lua voices further disdain, Keeper[N]
guards report in, citing a fleeing imperial[N]
soldier coming towards them...[AN]
...And also a bunch of pirates in pursuit.[AN]
Lua runs ahead to see more of the commotion,[N]
and recognizes Valerie from A4.[AN]
Demanding the Keepers hold their fire,[N]
Valerie rushes in through the perimeter,[N]
and quickly helps describe the situation.[AN]

As she does so, the Keepers report taking[N]
heavy losses, and that the pirates [N]
are about to breach their lines.[AN]
The supplier, knowing they don't [N]
have many able men ready to fight,[N]
realizes Lua is their only hope.[AN]
They offer supplies for free to Lua,[N]
which convinces her to help[N]
defend the village.[AN]
Valerie insists that they try[N]
to push through and help Calista.[AN]
Lua listens, and agrees, but[N]
cannot make any promises.[AN][X]

the Blackhearts still threat.[AN]

Lower that bridge down![AN]
Start pushing through that route![AN][X]

## C2_GriffonWarning_T6_CalistaAlive
What the hell's going on here?[AN]
Where is the captain?[AN]

She's betrayed us!
We found some rebels, and she[N]
flipped as soon as we took losses![AN]

And how are we supposed to
take your word for that?

Sir, I saw a girl wearing imperial 
armor behind in their lines.[AN]
With Captain Calista also
fighting his forces...[AN]
He's telling the truth.[AN]

Bloody...
Very well. 
Lieutenant, follow me and we'll
send a report back to the camp.
You two, maneuver from the back,
flank the captain's position. [AN]
We won't tolerate traitors in TORCH![AN]

Understood, sir![AN][X]
