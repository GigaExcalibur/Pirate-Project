## HubC4Pitch
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRemora]
[MR]
You! You're Captain Lua of the[N]
Skysabers, aren't you?[A]
[ML]
That I am. Has our infamy reached[N]
the Old World already?[AN]
Or are you someone I ought to know?[A]
[MR]
We've never met, though I certainly[N]
know of you and your crew.[AN]
In my hunt for lost treasure, your[N]
name keeps popping up.[AN]
Tomb of San Torino? Your crew beat me[N]
there by a week.[AN]
The Taklakama dunes? Cleaned out by[N]
the Skysabers just before I arrived.[AN]
Every time I get a lead, you're one[N]
step ahead of me.[AN]
[ML]
The dunes were a trap set by bandits[N]
to pray on treasure seekers.[A]
[MR]
Ah, well, I suppose that one worked[N]
out for me then.[AN]
Anyway, I propose as fellow treasure[N]
hunters we team up.[AN]
I've got a new job lined up but it's[N]
too big for me to pull off solo.[AN]
I know you're looking for a way off[N]
this rock, and with the profits,[AN]
you'll be well on your way to buying[N]
yourself a shiny new ship.[A]
[ML][1LB]
I'll bite. What's the job?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Some 50 years back, the Aquarius[N]
crashed into Thunderhead Rock,[AN]
a small isle to the northeast.[N]
All it's treasure is there for the[N]
taking, but naturally there's a catch.[AN]
Through some foul sorcery, the ghosts[N]
of its crew still guard its treasure.[A]
[ML][1LB]
So my Skysabers are the muscle.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Yeah. I've had my fair share of[N]
clashes with pirate ghosts,[N]
and they're no pushovers.[AN]
I've already got a buyer for the ship's[N]
strongbox lined up on this island.[AN]
We'll split that and the rest of the[N]
loot 50/50, since I'm providing the[N]
intel and transport. Sounds good?[A][X]

## HubC4Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRemora]
[ML]
You've got a deal.[N]
How soon can we depart?[AN]
[MR]
As soon as your crew is ready.[AN]
I've chartered a skiff that can[N]
fit a bit over a dozen.[AN]
By the way, are you a good swimmer?[A]
[ML]
Not particularly.[N]
Is the treasure underwater?[AN]
[MR]
Not sure, but the crash site is at[N]
least partially submerged.[AN]
I've got some spare swimwear lying[N]
around. Better safe than sorry, right?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
Will this even fit me..?[A]
[X]

## HubC4Selection_No
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRemora]
[ML]
Sorry, I'm still reviewing my options.[N]
I'll let you know if I change my mind.[A][X]

## HubC4WaterWarning1
[R][LoadRemora]
The water level's still rising.[AN]
If you can't swim or fly,[N]
get to higher ground!.[A][X]

## HubC4WaterWarning2
[R][LoadLua]
The next level's almost sunk.[AN]
Hurry up and let's get out of here[N]
while we still can![A][X]

## HubC4WaterWarning3
[R][LoadLua]
We're out of time. Forget fighting[N]
and looting, just get to the exit![AN][X]
