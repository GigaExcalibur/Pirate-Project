[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Looks like there are a few folks[N]
who might have work for us[Beat][AN]
Well, we'll need every bit of help[N]
that we can get if we're going to[N]
fly out of here any time soon,[AN]
and I've got no hope of strongarming[N]
them with Quispe and their guards[N]
watching our movements like hawks.[AN]
I'll see what the people have to[N]
say and deal with their problems,[N]
if they pay the right price.[A][X]

## HubCSayWhereToGo
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Hm[Beat] That's enough of the odd jobs.[N]
Any more, and I'll die of boredom.[N]
It's time for a bigger heist[Beat][AN]
Pilar should've gotten my message[N]
earlier. Tonight, I'll hear her[N]
final decision. To stay with us[Beat][AN]
Or to go back to her everyday life.[N]
[Beat]Damn, I'm all nervous now.[AN]
I'd better go back to my room[N]
and settle my nerves before then.[AN][X]

[ML]
[Beat]The shaking's finally stopped.[N]
It seems we've landed, Lua.[AN]
And no worse for wear,[N]
thanks to this saferoom.[AN]
Storing our essential supplies[N]
here was a prudent decision.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
If it's safe enough for the crew,[N]
it's safe enough for our loot,[N]
right? Still, we got lucky.[AN]
Who'd have thought T.O.R.C.H.[N]
coming after us in Port Greagor[N]
would end up saving our hides?[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] But if we had avoided them,[N]
then Alonso's thugs may not have[N]
forced us to take this risk.[AN]
[MR]
Well, you've got a point there.[AN]
I've got a bad feeling that he made[N]
it through that mess just fine,[N]
but we can deal with him later.[AN]
For now, let's check outside[N]
and see what's waiting for us.[N]
[Beat]Or more accurately, who.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Left][3LB]
Feels good to be back on steady[N]
land for a change, but damn,[N]
the ship's a complete mess.[AN]
Not sure that Rahel lass can[N]
magic up a fix for this heap.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We won't be flying any time soon,[N]
then. Miss Pilar, you said that[N]
people lived around here, right?[AN]
Do they have a ship that they could[N]
give to us so that we can leave?[A]
[FarRight]
[OQ]Could", sure. Anybody living this[N]
far from Incendivis has the means[N]
to fly. But [OQ]would" is different.[AN]
[Right]
Well, there's only way to find out.[N]
Which way do we go, Pilar?[N]
Let's ask them ourselves.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][2LB]
Any questions that you have[N]
can be directed to me, instead.[AN][X]

## HubCBeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Right]
What the[Beat] Who are you?[N]
The leader of Pilar's old pals?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
If you need a name, we are Keepers[N]
of a forgotten age with no masters,[N]
one Incendivis would like you to forget.[AN]
I suppose I represent our group[N]
more often than not in these matters,[N]
especially when pirates are involved,[AN]
but I do not consider myself or anyone[N]
a leader in the sense that you use it.[N]
We all rule ourselves and no one else.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar, I see you have returned.[N]
What information do you have for me?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Too much to share now, Quispe.[AN]
But for the time being, do you mind[N]
hearing out Lua's requests for aid?[AN]
She's helped me a great deal in my[N]
travels, and I'd see it repaid.[AN]
[R]
Wait, hold on a second here.[N]
You work for this[Beat] Quispe?[N]
What kind of name is that?[AN]
[ML]
In my tongue, a perfectly fine one,[N]
but I wouldn't expect those as ignorant[N]
as you pirates to comprehend this.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar understands my, and my flock's,[N]
vision. Our ideals and hopes align.[AN]
Those being toppling Incendivis,[N]
no matter how difficult the task.[AN]
[R]
The hell? You're a rebel, Pilar?[N]
I knew you had a bone to pick[N]
with the empire, but most pirates do.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I wasn't exactly subtle, was I?[AN]
My hatred for Incendivis runs deep,[N]
which caused me to leave it behind[N]
years ago and drift into the Old World.[AN]
There, I found this community[N]
of outsiders similar to me.[AN]
A man named Wayra gathered us here[N]
and made us into something more.[AN]
Ever since, I've journeyed outside[N]
the storms to gather information[N]
that we could use to strike back,[AN]
against the empire and its enforcers.[AN]
[R]
You[Beat] So you were just using us to[N]
get by until you could get back here?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]No, I truly enjoyed my time[N]
with the crew. That's why[Beat][AN]
Let me help you get back on your[N]
feet and on your way, Lua.[N]
This is no place for you.[AN]
[ML]
If that is your wish, Pilar,[N]
then so be it. Captain Lua,[N]
was it?[A] I have no love for pirates,[N]
but if you require some assistance,[N]
my flock may be able to help you.[AN]
Whether it be furnishing materials[N]
or manpower to repair your ship,[AN]
or supplying you with provisions[N]
to replace those you have lost,[N]
we have many resources to provide.[AN]
However, my flock has no obligation[N]
to you, and they may request that[N]
you provide them with aid in return.[AN]
Some pirates have ignored my warnings[N]
and tried to steal from our community,[N]
but I wouldn't recommend that path.[AN]
That is, if you wish to keep your lives.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Yeah, like I want to tangle with[N]
you and your wyvern. No thanks, Quispe.[AN]
Tell you what: I'll ask around later[N]
and see who's willing to part[N]
with what we need, and at what cost.[AN]
[FR]
Good. I know the people here well,[N]
so I can guide you around here, Lua.[AN]
For now, though, I have business[N]
to take care of with Quispe.[AN]
You all can stay in any of the empty[N]
lodges in the village up that path.[AN]
Come find me when you're ready,[N]
and I'll help you with any[N]
requests the people give you.[A][X]

Hmph[Beat] I could tell she had a soft[N]
side for rebels, but I hoped that[N]
it was somethin' she did a while ago.[AN]
But this whole time, she was spyin'[N]
for them[Beat] Who knows what she'll[N]
tell those rats about us, boss?[AN]
You sure you wanna let her walk away?[AN]
[MR]
Her allegiance is her business.[N]
[Beat]I'm the one in the wrong,[N]
trusting her despite the signs.[AN]
[FL]
Trusting people isn't wrong, Captain Lua.[AN]
Not ever. I know Miss Pilar isn't who[N]
we thought she was, but even still,[N]
I'm sure she means well for us.[AN]
If she didn't, we never would've[N]
made it this far in the first place.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, you're right, Raz, but[Beat][AN]
I just[Beat] I just can't believe that[N]
once our business is through here,[N]
she's gonna leave us out to dry.[AN]
Like none of the shit we've been[N]
through together mattered[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
I need to go cool my head, boss.[N][OpenEyes]
Call me if you need anything.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
I[Beat] I have a hard time imagining[N]
our crew without Miss Pilar, also.[N]
Maybe we can change her mind, captain?[AN]
If she'd listen to anyone on this,[N]
she'd listen to you. I'm sure of it.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]It's her choice to make, Razvan.[N]
I'm not going to bother convincing[N]
someone who doesn't want to be here.[AN]
She's done enough already, showing[N]
us a path out of this mess we're in.[N]
Let's get to walking it and move on.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
Captain Lua[Beat] Even if you[N]
give up on her, I won't![A][X]

## HubCBeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadPilar]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidLeft]
So, you're here. Good, good.[N]
Ready to go make the rounds?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ready as I'll ever be, Pilar.[N]
Fill me in on the details.[AN]
What's with these requests[N]
that Quispe mentioned yesterday?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
They're no different from those[N]
you'd find in any other part[N]
of the world. People have problems,[AN]
and some of the problems have no[N]
recourse beyond brute force.[AN]
That's where a roving pirate crew[N]
comes in handy, doesn't it?[AN]
No connections to the community[N]
means no pain if they fail.[AN]
[MR]
In other words, we're hired guns[N]
that are just as good dead as we[N]
are alive, to these Keepers. Wonderful.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
As Quispe said, us Keepers have tangled[N]
with pirates before and suffered for it.[AN]
I'm more open-minded than the others,[N]
naturally. I've been one long enough.[AN]
[MR]
A fake one, but whatever you say.[N]
Let's get moving already, Pilar.[AN]
That way, you can get back to your[N]
perfect life here all the sooner.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]You couldn't be further from the truth,[N]
Lua. If Wayra still led the Keepers,[N]
perhaps, but Quispe[Beat] Who knows?[AN]
Since Wayra passed a few months back,[N]
things around here[Beat] They've changed.[AN]
Old age, they said? We'll see what[N]
I can discover while I'm here,[N]
and what the truth really is[Beat][A][X]

[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Missed me, Captain Lua?[N]
It's been a long time.[ToggleSmile][AN]
How's the noble brat[N]
you took off my hands?[A]
[MR]
Hermenegildo? He's made himself[N]
useful in the past few months.[AN]
Turns out he's a halfway[N]
decent swordsman, after all.[A]
[ML]
Now that's a surprise.[AN]
[Beat]But I didn't come here[N]
to banter about the past.[AN]
Lua, I[Beat] need your help.[A]
[MR][1LB]
What? Why?[A]
[ML][2LB]
My Rioja Reapers[Beat] [CloseEyes]picked[N]
a fight we couldn't win.[AN]
Now they're dead, and the force[N]
we were up against remains.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I need it stopped, and soon.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]For her sake.[A]
[MR]
I've never known you to[N]
make this little sense.[AN]
Before I help you with whatever[N]
it is you're planning,[AN]
I need to at least know[N]
the full story first.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Fine, then. I've nowhere[N]
else to turn to for a hand.[AN]
Do you know the[N]
name Count Sanz?[A]
[MR]
Some Imperial noble with[N]
a reputation as a hoarder.[AN]
My crew actually pulled a[N]
heist on him a while back.[A]
[ML]
His bodyguard, Yurena, is [ToggleSmile]far more[N]
competent than Sanz deserves[ToggleSmile].[AN]
She and I have been chasing each[N]
other around the Empire for years.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]Sure.[A]
[ML][3LB]
We found her and her[N]
wretched boss delving[N]
some ruins near here[Beat][AN]
but Yurena herself was[N]
nowhere to be found,[AN]
and the rest of Sanz's guards[N]
slew my crew to the last.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Lanzarote, my first mate,[N]
clung to life just long[N]
enough to get me here.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I'm looking for revenge, Lua.[N]
That, and a chance to make sure[N]
Yurena didn't die in that pit.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm sorry for your loss, Ruby.[AN]
I can only imagine what it's like[N]
to lose your whole crew like that.[AN]
[OpenEyes]But the Skysabers are[N]
stranded on this island, too.[AN]
We can't just work for free.[A]
[ML]
Then take the Grapevine. My ship.[AN]
The rebels here say yours isn't[N]
much more than driftwood.[A]
[MR][1LB]
You'd give it away so easily?[A]
[ML][2LB]

An island not far from here,[N]

I'll gather my crew and[N]

Why are you putting yourself at[N]
this sort of risk for my sake?[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]I'd say it's for the[N]
chance at taking your ship,[N]
but that wouldn't be true.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Really, I'm here because of[N]
your story about Yurena.[AN]
[Beat]I know what it's like, to[N]

You! You're Captain Lua of the[N]
Skysabers, aren't you?[A]
[ML]
That I am. Has our infamy reached[N]
the Old World already?[AN]
Or are you someone I ought to know?[A]
[MR]
We've never met, though I certainly[N]
know of you and your crew.[AN]
In my hunt for lost treasure, your[N]
name keeps popping up.[AN]
Tomb of San Torino? Your crew beat me[N]
there by a week.[AN]
The Taklakama dunes? Cleaned out by[N]
the Skysabers just before I arrived.[AN]
Every time I get a lead, you're one[N]
step ahead of me.[AN]
[ML]
The dunes were a trap set by bandits[N]
to pray on treasure seekers.[A]
[MR]
Ah, well, I suppose that one worked[N]
out for me then.[AN]
Anyway, I propose as fellow treasure[N]
hunters we team up.[AN]
I've got a new job lined up, but it's[N]
too big for me to pull off solo.[AN]
I know you're looking for a way off[N]
this rock, and with the profits,[AN]
you'll be well on your way to buying[N]
yourself a shiny new ship.[A]
[ML][1LB]
I'll bite. What's the job?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Some 50 years back, the Aquarius[N]
crashed into Thunderhead Rock,[AN]
a small isle to the northeast.[AN]
All its treasure is there for the[N]
taking, but naturally there's a catch.[AN]
Through some foul sorcery, the ghosts[N]
of its crew still guard its treasure.[A]
[ML][1LB]
So my Skysabers are the muscle.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Yeah. I've had my fair share of[N]
clashes with pirate ghosts,[N]
and they're no pushovers.[AN]
I've already got a buyer for the ship's[N]
strongbox lined up on this island.[AN]
We'll split that and the rest of the[N]
loot 50/50, since I'm providing the[N]
intel and transport. Sounds good?[A][X]

You've got a deal.[N]

As soon as your crew is ready.[AN]

fit a bit over a dozen.[AN]
By the way, are you a good swimmer?[A]
[ML]
Not particularly.[N]
Is the treasure underwater?[AN]
[MR]
Not sure, but the crash site is at[N]
least partially submerged.[AN]
I've got some spare swimwear lying[N]
around. Better safe than sorry, right?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
Will this even fit me[Beat]?[A]

## HubC4Rejected
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRemora]

[MidLeft]
If it means I can leave home,[N]
then I'll do whatever it takes![N]
I'll get to work right away![A][X]

[MidLeft]
Ah, hello there, Captain Lua![AN]
I've heard a lot about you[N]
from the villagers recently.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I can't say I've heard anything[N]
about you. What's your name, man?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
I'm Kurt, a mercenary. Ended up here[N]
after a job gone wrong, so I've been[N]
stuck doing odds and ends for Keepers.[AN]
I've kept watch for promising crews[N]
coming in and out of the harbor,[N]
but none showed up til you guys.[AN]
I'd like to offer my services[N]
to you, if you'll have me.[AN]
[MidRight]
What services might those be, and[N]
what am I meant to pay for them?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Besides my wolf buddy here?[N]
I've got a solid speararm,[N]
and I'm not bad with knives.[AN]
Beyond that[Beat] This might sound odd,[N]
but I've always been luckily unlucky.[AN]
In battle, strange things always happen[N]
to me, but somehow, whoever I'm fighting[N]
always pays for it. Weird, isn't it?[AN]
But it might help you out, captain.[N]
I'm like a good bad luck charm![N]
At the low, low price of 1000 gold![A][X]

## HubCKurtRecruitmentChoice

(Should I hire Kurt now?)[Yes][X]

## HubCKurtRecruitmentYes
[MidLeft][LoadKurt]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Ha, you really thought that was[N]
a good way to sell yourself?[N]
Telling me you've got bad luck?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I-Is that a no, captain?[AN]
[MidRight]
It isn't. You've definitely got the look[N]
of a capable fighter, and I'm not going[N]
to turn down any of those right now.[AN]
Just[Beat] Stay far away from everyone[N]
else on the crew, if that story about[N]
your luck's real. Otherwise, you're out.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You got it, boss! I swear, I'll follow[N]
every one of your orders to the letter.[N]
Man[Beat] I'm just so glad to have a job![AN]
This would've been my fiftieth rejection,[N]
so I[Beat] I can't thank you enough![N]
I'll earn my keep. Count on it![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
He was shot down that many times?[N]
I might've made a big mistake[Beat][AN][X]

## HubCKurtRecruitmentNo
[MidLeft][LoadKurt]
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
[Beat]Those are some dubious selling[N]
points, so I'll pass on hiring you.[AN]
For now, I have enough crewmates[N]
to get by, and you sound like[N]
more trouble than you're worth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Just my luck, huh[Beat] Well,[N]
suit yourself, captain.[AN]
If you change your mind,[N]
I'll be around for a while[N]
unless somebody hires me.[AN]
Which[Beat] I don't see that[N]
happening any time soon.[AN]
[MidRight]
You know[Beat] You really shouldn't[N]
tell a potential employer that[N]
they've got no competition, Kurt.[A][X]

Oh, you uh, don't have it?[AN]
Wow, that's[Beat] Hm. Guess[N]
you all did just crash,[N]
so maybe I shouldn't judge.[AN]
Let me know if you scrounge[N]
up some gold and find some[N]
room in the budge to hire me.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]You the new captain[N]
strutting around here?[A]
[MidRight]
You could say that.[N]
Who's asking?[AN]
[MidLeft]
The name's Theana. I need a job,[N]
and you need a stronger crew.[AN]
So I figured I'd cut to the chase.[N]
How about you hire me, captain?[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Well, you're certainly direct[Beat][N]
I've got plenty of crewmates as it is.[N]
What makes you so special, Theana?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm the best at what I do; murder.[N]
I can see the ambition in your eyes.[N]
You've got big plans here, right?[AN]
Hire me, and I'll see them through[N]
by killing anyone in your way.[AN]
Upfront, I want[Beat] Mm, 2000 gold.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadTheana]
[MidRight][LoadLua]

[Beat]You don't have the money?[N]
I don't work on IOUs, captain.[N]

(Should I hire Theana now?)[Yes][X]

## HubCTheanaRecruitmentYes
[MidLeft][LoadTheana]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[Beat]Sure, why not? Having another warm[N]
body's always helpful, so even if[N]
your bite doesn't match your bark,[AN]
I'll find a use for you, Theana.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Doubting me, huh? Be that way.[N]
I'll show you why I'm worth the[N]
gold, soon enough. Count on it.[A][X]

## HubCTheanaRecruitmentNo
[MidLeft][LoadTheana]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
I respect the gusto, but sorry,[N]
I'm not interested right now.[N]
If I change my mind, I'll let you know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Fair enough. I've got business[N]
to settle, so I'll stick around[N]
a bit longer. Don't keep me waiting.[AN][X]

I'm telling you: I'm not going[N]
anywhere, Carmen. So give me[N]
a break already, will you?[AN]
[Left][LoadCarmen]
No, I don't think that I will.[N]
[Beat]Oh, here comes the captain![N]
How about I tell her the truth?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Oh, you petty-[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
What's all this about, you two?[N]
I could hear your bickering[N]
from across the damn village.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Uh, sorry about that, Captain Lua.[N]
It's nothing worth your time,[N]
though. Just small stuff, really.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Heh.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
If it's enough to draw my attention,[N]
then yes, it is worth my time.[AN]
But if you won't tell me what's[N]
going on, then maybe she will.[N]
Carmen, you'd better explain. Now.[AN]
[Left]
Well, well, it looks like I have no[N]
choice. Ah, what a shame it is to spill[N]
Jaime's deepest and darkest secrets![AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]You're gonna regret this, Carmen.[AN]
[Left]
Again, I don't think that I will.[N]
Get this, captain: Jaime's actually[Beat][N]
Drum roll, if you will[Beat] My cousin![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Oh, so that's what it was.[N]
I already could tell you two[N]
were related. Pretty obvious.[AN]
[Left]
H-Huh?! Was it our hair?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hair color? Who would use that[N]
as sole proof that you're family?[AN]
No, I just observed you two[N]
closely, just like everyone else.[N]
Even way back in Port Greagor,[N]
it was clear as day to me that[N]
you had some kind of past.[AN]
And Carmen doesn't seem the type[N]
to have many friends, so when put[N]
together with your resemblance[Beat][AN]
[Left]
How rude! I do have friends! Lots![N]
Like Miss Fata, who teaches me[N]
some of her magical tricks[Beat][AN]
Or Ximo! Yes, Ximo and I are[N]
the best of friends, captain![N]
Boon companions, even![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Anyway, that still doesn't explain[N]
what the two of you were arguing[N]
about. What's the issue, exactly?[AN]
[Left]
Hold on, you cannot just insult me[N]
and then change the subject-[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ah, well[Beat] Carmen's mad that I won't[N]
tell her more about why I left the[N]
del Rias family. Says I owe it to her.[AN]
But I don't think it's her business,[N]
or anyone else's. So long as I'm doing[N]
my job, my secrets are my own, right?[AN]
[MidRight]
That's always been my policy, yeah.[N]
Besides, it isn't hard to tell why[N]
you went your own way, is it?[AN]
Can't fight against the empire[N]
trapped inside a gilded cage.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]There's more to it, but yeah,[N]
that's pretty much the crux of it.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]It isn't just that I should know,[N]
captain. Hector[Beat] Or rather, Jaime,[N]
was the heir apparent of our family.[AN]
I wouldn't be surprised if there were[N]
search parties looking for him, now[Beat][N]
That would mean trouble for us, yes?[AN]
[FarLeft]
And like I said, they're not looking[N]
for me. They wouldn't want to, y'know?[N]
[Beat]My sis was the golden child, not me.[AN]
So it's like I was telling Carmen,[N]
before you got here. I'm not going[N]
anywhere, and no one's coming for me.[AN]
[MidRight]
That so? Well, if you say so.[N]
You've stuck by us long enough[N]
that I'll trust you on that.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]If the captain has no objections,[N]
then I suppose I should drop mine, too.[N]
For your many flaws, Jaime, you're[Beat][AN]
Capable, more than you credit yourself.[N]
We would be lucky if you stayed with us.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ha[Beat] What's got into you, Carmen?[N]
Kindness really doesn't suit you.[AN]
[Left]
Y-You oaf! For once, I make the mistake[N]
of attempting to lift your spirits,[N]
and you respond like this? Why, I ought-[AN][CSSCF]
[FarLeft][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
Ugh, again? I'll just leave them[N]
alone and let them get it all out.[AN]
Damned del Rias family[Beat] If I ever[N]
meet them myself, I'm gonna make[N]
them pay for all the trouble![AN][X]
