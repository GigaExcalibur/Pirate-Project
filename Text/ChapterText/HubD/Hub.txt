[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR]
Captain Lua. Still picking[N]
where to fly, right?[A]
[ML]
With the Fire Emblem, the[N]
whole sky's our oyster.[AN]
[Beat]Something's on your mind, Desi.[N]
I know you well enough to see it.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[CloseEyes]Francisca was the same[N]
way, back then. Both of[N]
you see right through me[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll just cut to the chase.[N]
I've found Rogelio.[A]
[ML][2LB]
The traitor from your old crew?[AN]
I know you've been on his[N]
trail for a while, but[Beat][AN]
how did you manage that?[A]
[MR][3LB]
He had a contact back[N]
in the Keepers' village.[AN]
Some cowardly little man[N]
[CloseEyes]named[Beat][OpenEyes] Boru, I recall.[AN]
While we were back in town,[N]
planning our raid on the[N]
Fire Emblem's shrine[Beat][AN]
[Smile]I finally got my[N]
answers out of him.[Smile][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]Right.[AN]
Where is he, then? If that's[N]
to be our next destination.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Rogelio and his men are holed up[N]
at some desolate little rock[N]
on the edge of the skies.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Not too different from[N]
old Snowthorne, really.[AN][OpenEyes]
Folk call it the Icy Crown.[N]
Some ruin lifted up from[N]
the Lands Below long ago.[AN]
All that matters to me,[N]
though, is who's inside.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Sounds like quite the place.[AN]
I'd guess Rogelio has already[N]
cleared out any plunder that-[A]
[MR]
This isn't about treasure any more.[AN]
We have the Fire Emblem. That's[N]
all we could ever want for loot.[AN]
No, this is about revenge.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I want that bastard dead for[N]
what he did to the Roseblades.[AN]
His face's haunted my nightmares[N]
since before I joined the Skysabers.[AN]
[OpenEyes]We have to go to the Icy Crown, Lua.[AN]
We have to make sure the Roseblades[N]
finally get to rest in peace.[A][X]

## HubD1Selection_Yes
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
[Smile]It's been good having you[N]
as a quartermaster, Desi.[AN]
You've saved us all from[N]
disaster time and time again.[AN]
It's the least I can do to[N]
help you set things right.[A][Smile]
[MR]
Glad to hear.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Thanks, Captain Lua.[AN]
[Smile]I'm glad to be part[N]
of a crew like yours.[OpenEyes][A][Smile]
[ML]
[Smile]It's the least I can do.[AN][Smile]
I'll bring Pilar up[N]
to speed on the route,[AN]
and we'll set off for the[N]
Icy Crown as soon as we can.[A][CSSCF]
[MR]
[CloseEyes]Francisca[Beat][AN]
I'll bring you justice.[N]
Once and for all.[A][X]


## HubD1Selection_No
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]What the hell, Lua?[A]
[ML][2LB]
Calm down, Desi.[AN]
I understand that this is[N]
important to you, but-[A]
[MR][MoveRight]
[R][3LB]
I've followed you through[N]
thick and thin, Captain.[AN]
[CloseEyes]I've gone on every job you[N]
thought was worth your time.[AN]
I even held my tongue when we[N]
worked for the damn Rebels![AN]
[OpenEyes]But what was the point,[AN]
if all that's out the[N]
window the instant I'm[N]
the one needing your help?[A]
[ML]
Damn it, Desi, you know[N]
that's not what I meant![AN]
Of course I'm fine with[N]
helping my second in command.[AN]
That's what being[N]
part of a crew is for.[AN]
It's just[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm not ready to commit[N]
to a job like this.[AN]
Not with the state the[N]
sky is in right now.[AN][OpenEyes]
We'll go after Rogelio soon.[N]
I swear it as your Captain.[A]
[R][1LB]
[Beat]Right.[A] [OpenQuote]Soon."[AN]
Let's hope so, Captain Lua.[A][X]
